	abstract = {Increasing volumes of data allow environmental scientists to use machine learning to construct data-driven models of phenomena. These models can provide decision-relevant predictions, but confident decision-making requires that the involved uncertainties are understood. We argue that existing frameworks for characterizing uncertainties are not appropriate for data-driven models because of their focus on distinct locations of uncertainty. We propose a framework for uncertainty assessment that uses argument analysis to assess the justification of the assumption that the model is fit for the predictive purpose at hand. Its flexibility makes the framework applicable to data-driven models. The framework is illustrated using a case study from environmental science. We show that data-driven models can be subject to substantial second-order uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in the assessment of the predictive uncertainty, because they are often applied to ill-understood problems. We close by discussing the implications of the predictive uncertainties of data-driven models for decision-making.},

	abstract = {Evolution of flow characteristics through finite-sized wind farms and the influence of the wind-farm configuration on modulating this evolution is explored through numerical simulations. The principal aim for the study is to identify regions of flow-adjustment and flow equilibrium within the wind farm. Towards this aim, a suite of five large-eddy simulations (LES) of the neutral atmospheric boundary layer with extremely long streamwise domains are performed with embedded finite-sized wind farms of different streamwise and spanwise spacing. Three diagnostic variables, namely, the wind-farm induced effective surface roughness, the wake viscosity and the wake-expansion coefficient are computed using the LES-generated database and are used to characterize the flow. Computation of the diagnostic variables is relevant to the wind-energy community in different contexts ranging from parametrization of wind farms in weather and climate models, to wind-farm design and optimization based on wake-models and eddy-viscosity type Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solvers. Results show that flow equilibrium is achieved in the ‘most dense’ configuration of sx≈8D,sy≈5D at approximately the 19th row. Results also indicate that the streamwise spacing plays a dominant role determining the rate at which flow-adjustment is achieved within the wind farm.},

	abstract = {We present results from large eddy simulations of extended wind-farms for several turbine configurations with a range of different spanwise and streamwise spacing combinations. The results show that for wind-farms arranged in a staggered configuration with spanwise spacings in the range ≈[3.5,8]D, where D is the turbine diameter, the power output in the fully developed regime depends primarily on the geometric mean of the spanwise and streamwise turbine spacings. In contrast, for the aligned configuration the power output in the fully developed regime strongly depends on the streamwise turbine spacing and shows weak dependence on the spanwise spacing. Of interest to the rate of wake recovery, we find that the power output is well correlated with the vertical kinetic energy flux, which is a measure of how much kinetic energy is transferred into the wind-turbine region by the mean flow. A comparison between the aligned and staggered configurations reveals that the vertical kinetic energy flux is more localized along turbine columns for aligned wind-farms than for staggered ones. This additional mixing leads to a relatively fast wake recovery for aligned wind-farms. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The development of large scale wind farms that can compete with conventional energy resources presents significant challenges to today's wind energy industry. A powerful solution to these daunting challenges can be offered by a synergistic consideration of the key design elements (turbine selection and placement) and the variations in the natural resource. This paper significantly advances the Unrestricted Wind Farm Layout Optimization (UWFLO) method, enabling it to simultaneously optimize the placement and the selection of turbines for commercial-scale wind farms that are subject to varying wind conditions. The advanced UWFLO method avoids the following limiting traditional assumptions: (i) array/grid-wise layout pattern, (ii) fixed wind condition, or unimodal and univariate distribution of wind conditions, and (iii) the specification of a fixed and uniform type of turbine to be installed in the farm. Novel modifications are made to the formulation of the inter-turbine wake interactions, which allow turbines with differing features and power characteristics to be considered in the UWFLO method. The annual energy production is estimated using the joint distribution of wind speed and direction. A recently developed Kernel Density Estimation-based model that can adequately represent multimodal wind data is employed to characterize the wind distribution. A response surface-based wind farm cost model is also developed and implemented to evaluate and favorably constrain the Cost of Energy of the designed farm. The selection of commercially available turbines introduces discrete variables into the optimization problem; this challenging problem is solved using an advanced mixed-discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of this wind farm optimization methodology is illustrated by applying it to design a 25-turbine wind farm in N. Dakota. A remarkable improvement of 6.4\% in the farm capacity factor is accomplished when the farm layout and the turbine selection are simultaneously optimized.},

	abstract = {To date, research on demand side management has mostly focused on the determinants of electricity consumption and stated preference experiments to understand social acceptability. Further experimental research is needed to identify the determinants for demand response schemes. This paper contributes to addressing this gap by making use of data from a randomised control trial which contains 15 months of smart meter electricity data combined with household characteristics and differences in incentives to shift their electricity use between 11am and 3pm. Cluster analysis performed on electricity data identified three distinct electricity daily load profiles. Each cluster was then linked to household characteristics by means of a multinomial logistic regression to identify the determinants of the load curves' shapes. Findings show that occupancy presence at home, age and appliance ownership were strong predictors. Finally, this paper is among the first to provide experimental evidence on the determinants of load shifting. We find that households with head aged above 65, households who belong to the cluster exhibiting a load profile characterised by a relatively high peak at noon and a low peak in the evening, and those who received money incentives were more likely to shift electricity use towards middle of the day (11am-3pm).},

	abstract = {Physics-based models of dynamical systems are often used to study engineering and environmental systems. Despite their extensive use, these models have several well-known limitations due to simplified representations of the physical processes being modeled or challenges in selecting appropriate parameters. While-state-of-the-art machine learning models can sometimes outperform physics-based models given ample amount of training data, they can produce results that are physically inconsistent. This paper proposes a physics-guided recurrent neural network model (PGRNN) that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementary strengths and improves the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we show that a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physics-based models, while generating outputs consistent with physical laws. An important aspect of our PGRNN approach lies in its ability to incorporate the knowledge encoded in physics-based models. This allows training the PGRNN model using very few true observed data while also ensuring high prediction accuracy. Although we present and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics of temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientific and engineering disciplines where physics-based (also known as mechanistic) models are used, e.g., climate science, materials science, computational chemistry, and biomedicine.},

The analysis was performed on one year of smart meter electricity demand data from 656 households in Switzerland. We present a rigorous assessment of sample aggregation and clustering approaches for creating representative electricity demand profiles. We propose a clustering method using five features defining the shape of household electricity demand profiles, which demonstrates significantly improved cluster quality relative to using raw profile data. The cluster analysis of average household electricity demand profiles resulted in three distinct clusters, which challenges the assumption made by Swiss energy norms that one standard pattern fits all homes. Furthermore, cluster analysis of daily demand profiles within the household was performed, resulting in four distinct clusters and demonstrating that daily raw profiles for a household significantly differ from the average profile for that household. Averaging the data suppresses the diversity of the electricity use patterns within the individual household. Electricity demand profiles have important implications for policy makers, particularly if time of use tariffs are introduced to match future stochastic renewable energy supply.},

Its optimized and profitable use, however, requires an estimation of the potential in locations of interest, given its very volatile behavior in various settings. In the present study, we propose a methodology using a combination of Machine Learning (Random Forests), Geographic Information Systems and wind parametric models to estimate the large-scale theoretical wind speed potential in rural areas over the entire Switzerland. The monthly wind speed over rural areas is estimated based on wind speed measurements and several meteorological, topographic, and wind-specific features available accross the country. Wind speed values and their associated uncertainty are computed at the scale of 200 x 200 [m2] pixels covering the territory, at a typical height for rural commercial wind turbine installation, that is, z=100m. The developed methodology, is, however, applicable to any large region, given the availability of data of interest. The results show that in the case of Switzerland, wind turbines could approximately represent an non-negligible installed power capacity of, for each pixel and for each turbine installation, on average 80 kW in Swiss rural areas, and up to 1600 kW in most suitable pixels.},

	abstract = {The reduction of energy consumption in the existing building stock is a crucial element of the Swiss Energy Strategy 2050 in view of the fact that the built environment accounts for more than 44\% of the final energy use in Switzerland. It is therefore necessary to characterise the Swiss building stock and in particular the residential sector at an appropriate degree of detail, distinguishing between various types of buildings (archetypes) and building elements in order to identify the untapped potential for energy retrofit. In this paper, the current thermal performance and retrofit state of the Swiss residential building stock is examined based on approximately 10,400 Cantonal Building Energy Certificates issued for individual buildings across the country. The statistical analysis of the certificates allows to estimate a thermal performance level of archetype buildings and their respective building elements as well as of the heating systems. For this purpose, we develop a method allowing to obtain typical U-Values for original and retrofitted buildings from the total U-Value distributions. Our results indicate that approximately 75\% of all building elements do not yet reach the thermal performance of buildings constructed in the last 15 years. In order to reach current low-energy building standards (MINERGIE P), the U-Values of building elements constructed prior to 1990 would have to be reduced by a factor of three to more than six, from 0.5–1 W/(m²K) to 0.15 W/(m²K); windows would require an improvement by at least a factor of two, from 2.5–2 to 0.9 W/(m²K). With regard to heat supply, 50\% of the surface area is still heated by inefficient and CO2-intensive oil-fired boilers. The results of this study hence confirm the high potential for thermal retrofit in the Swiss residential building stock.},

	abstract = {Reducing space heating demand from the residential building stock has been established as a crucial element of the energy transition across Europe. Focusing on Switzerland, this paper presents a bottom-up model (SwissRes) which allows to analyse the demand for space heating by building element and by building archetype (54 archetypes in total). The model is based on detailed data on the building envelope and heating systems of over 25,000 Cantonal Building Energy Performance Certificates (CECB PLUS). We identify three building characteristics which result in above-average final energy demand: rural typology (18\% higher than urban), single-family houses (41\% higher than multi-family) and in particular age of buildings (525\% higher from newest to oldest). In combination, these three factors can lead to up to seven times higher demand per m2 and year in extreme cases compared to the most efficient archetype. Among buildings constructed before 1970, single-family houses (SFH) show very high specific final energy demand for space heating ranging between 170 and 200 kWh/m². On the national level, SFHs and multi-family houses (MFH) are featuring almost identical shares of total final energy demand. Buildings in suburban areas account for almost 50\% of the total final energy demand. In total, the buildings constructed before 1980 account for 70\% of the national final energy demand for space heating, with buildings constructed before 1920 contributing 22\%. Most heat is lost through walls (40\%) followed by windows (25\%), roofs (17\%) and the floor (18\%). Losses from walls are particular high (73 kWh/m²) for buildings constructed between 1920 and 1945. Given the scalability of the model, it is readily applicable not only for the country as a whole but also for a province (canton), a city or a larger neighbourhood. The energy demand by archetype and building element identified with the SwissRes model can be used to assess the techno-economic potential of large-scale energy retrofit scenarios.},

To analyze effects of high shares of fluctuating renewable electricity generation on a European scale, this paper provides a bottom-up approach for modeling hourly electricity output based on meteorological data and technical specifications for different reference plants. Electricity output for wind power is based on hourly data on wind speed, ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure and calculated considering different turbine power curves and hub heights. Calculation accuracy, notably reproduction of intraday characteristics, was significantly improved by assessing and accounting for atmospheric layering. Calculation of electricity generation from solar photovoltaic plants is based on historical hourly data on solar radiation and ambient temperature. The plant output is calculated considering module technology, mounting, module temperature and load dependent array and inverter efficiency.},

In this paper we apply a supervised method based on convolutional neural networks to delineate rooftop solar panels and to detect their sizes by means of pixel-wise image segmentation. As input to the algorithm, we rely on high resolution aerial photos provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Topography. We explore different data augmentation and we vary network parameters in order to maximize model performance. Preliminary results show that we are able to automatically detect in test images the area of a set of solar panels at pixel level with an accuracy of about 0.94 and an Intersection over Union index of up to 0.64. The scalability of the trained model allows to predict the existing solar panels deployment at the Swiss national scale. The correlation with local environmental and socio-economic variables would allow to extract predictive models to foster future adoption of solar technology in urban areas.},

	title = {Direct {Utilization} of {Geothermal} {Energy} 2020 {Worldwide} {Review}},
	abstract = {This paper presents a review of the worldwide applications of geothermal energy for direct utilization and updates the previous survey carried out in 2015. We also compare data from WGC1995, WGC2000, WGC2005, WGC2010, and WGC2015 presented at World Geothermal Congresses in Italy, Japan, Turkey, Indonesia and Australia. As in previous reports, an effort is made to quantify geothermal (ground-source) heat pump data. The present report is based on country update papers received from 62 countries and regions reporting on their direct utilization of geothermal energy. Twenty-six additional countries were added to the list based on other sources of information. Thus, direct utilization of geothermal energy in a total of 88 countries is an increase from 82 in 2015, 78 reported in 2010, 72 reported in 2005, 58 reported in 2000, and 28 reported in 1995. An estimation of the installed thermal power for direct utilization at the end of 2019 is used in this paper and equals 107,727 MWt, a 52.0\% increase over the 2015 data, growing at a compound rate of 8.73\% annually. The thermal energy used is 1,020,887 TJ/yr (283,580 GWh/yr.), a 72.3\% increase over 2015, growing at a compound rate of 11.5\% annually. The distribution of thermal energy used by category is approximately 58.8\% for geothermal (ground-source) heat pumps, 18.0\% for bathing and swimming (including balneology), 16.0\% for space heating (of which 91.0\% is for district heating), 3.5\% for greenhouse heating, 1.6\% for industrial applications, 1.3\% for aquaculture pond and raceway heating, 0.4\% for agricultural drying, 0.2\% for snow melting and cooling, and 0.2\% for other applications. Energy savings amounts to 596 million barrels (81.0 million tonnes) of equivalent oil annually, preventing 78.1 million tonnes of carbon and 252.6 million tonnes of CO2 from being released to the atmosphere. This includes savings for geothermal heat pumps in the cooling mode, compared to using fuel oil to generate electricity. Since it is almost impossible to separate direct-use from electric power generation for the following, they are combined: approximately 2,647 wells were drilled in 42 countries, 34,500 person-years of effort were allocated in 59 countries, and US \$22.262 billion invested in projects by 53 countries.},

In this study, a building stock model combined with Monte Carlo method was implemented and extended to estimate the current and future space cooling demand in the Swiss service sector. Building level analysis of the space cooling diffusion and cooling systems characteristics and their evolution under climate change was conducted. The results of this study show that the space cooling demand in the Swiss service sector is 900 ± 200 GWh/year in 2015 and that it will increase approximately 400\% in representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6, 500\% in RCP 4.5, and 600\% in RCP 8.5 by 2050. During the same period, growth in space cooling saturation rate (180-200\%) is the major driver of demand growth, more than increases in total service area (35\%) and cooling energy intensity (30-70\%). In addition, total floor area, service area, ground floor area, and building age were identified as strong predictors of probability of presence of space cooling equipment.},

In order to contribute to its market consolidation, this work focuses on bringing to light relevant spatial information affecting the suitability of SGE exploitation.

The relative area and the amount of population affected per indicator was spatially analyzed to determine the most common values found and the affected population. The relationship between area percentage and population affected percentage per indicator was also analyzed and allowed to identify the most common indicators values in areas where high energy demands are expected.

Two development scenarios (densification and expansion) are proposed for the village Hemberg in Switzerland for the years 2030 and 2050. The results show that, with reference to 2017, global warming increases the cooling demand of the buildings by 70\% in 2030 and by 115\% in 2050. The results also suggest that renovation is the key element for the future energy management and efficiency improvement in Hemberg because the building insulation has much greater effect on the energy demand than the urban form. Furthermore, the results suggest that a grid-integrated energy hub consisting of wind turbines and PV panels can supply 77\% of the annual energy demand in 2050. Also, urban form has great effects on building-integrated PV generation and, in general, on the integration of renewable technologies.

A multistory building with varying thermal insulation levels and internal heat gains, and a ﬁxed window area fraction of 30\% was considered. For the time horizon 2050–2100, a climatic warm reference year scenario was used that foresees a 4.4 8C rise in mean annual air temperature relative to the 1961–1990 climatological normals and is thereby roughly in line with the climate change predictions made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The calculation results show a 33–44\% decrease in the annual heating energy demand for Swiss residential buildings for the period 2050–2100. The annual cooling energy demand for ofﬁce buildings with internal heat gains of 20–30 W/m2 will increase by 223–1050\% while the heating energy demand will fall by 36–58\%. A shortening of the heating season by up to 53 days can be observed. The study shows that efﬁcient solar protection and night ventilation strategies capable of keeping indoor air temperatures within an acceptable comfort range and obviating the need for cooling plant are set to become a crucial building design issue. \# 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The extraction of shallow geothermal energy using borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) is a promising approach for decarbonisation of the heating sector. However, a dense deployment of BHEs may lead to thermal interference between neighboring boreholes and thereby to over-exploitation of the heat capacity of the ground. Here we propose a novel method to estimate the technical potential of BHEs which takes into account potential thermal interference as well as the available area for BHE installations. The method combines simulation of the long-term heat extraction through BHEs for a range of borehole spacings and depths and includes an optimisation step to maximise the heat extraction. Application of the method to a case study in western Switzerland, from an available area of 284km2, yields an annual technical potential of 4.65TWh and a maximum energy density of 15.5kWh/m2. The results also suggest that, for a minimum borehole spacing of 5m and a maximum borehole depth of 200m, the cumulative installed borehole depth should not exceed 2km/ha. The estimated technical potential can be used by urban planners for the techno-economic analysis of BHE systems and by policy makers to develop strategies that encourage the use of shallow geothermal energy.},

Global and local climate change in combination with the projected population increase and economic development is expected to increase tremendously the future cooling energy demand of buildings and make it the dominant energy component. The present paper aims to present and discuss the details of the framework which defines the present and future cooling energy consumption of the building sector. The more recent quantitative and qualitative data concerning the penetration of air conditioning around the world are presented and analyzed. The main technological, economic, environmental and social drivers that determine the market penetration of air conditioning are identified and their impact is investigated. The potential future evolution of the main parameters that define the cooling energy consumption and in particular climate change, the population increase, income growth, potential technological improvements and the main socioeconomic drivers are investigated and existing forecasts are presented. Proposed methodologies to predict the future cooling energy consumption of the building sector are reported and discussed, while existing estimates and predictions regarding the future cooling energy consumption of individual buildings as well as of the total building sector are documented, evaluated and analyzed. Based on the explored inputs and forecasts, a model to predict the future cooling energy consumption of both the residential and commercial sector is developed. Three scenarios based on low, average and high future development, compared to the current development, are created and the range of the expected cooling energy demand in 2050 is predicted under various boundary assumptions. It is calculated that the average cooling energy demand of the residential and commercial buildings in 2050, will increase up to 750\% and 275\% respectively.},

The GSHPs are proven renewable energy technology for space heating and cooling. This paper provides a detailed literature review of the GSHP systems, and their recent advances. The operation principle and energy efficiency of a heat pump are defined first. Then, a general introduction on the GSHPs and its development, and a detailed description of the surface water (SWHP), ground-water (GWHP), and ground-couplet (GCHP) heat pumps are performed. The most typical simulation and ground thermal response test models for the vertical ground heat exchangers currently available are summarized including the heat transfer processes outside and inside the boreholes. Also, some information about a new GWHP using a heat exchanger with special construction, and the possibility to obtain the better energy efficiency with combined heating and cooling by GCHP are presented. The various hybrid GCHP systems for cooling or heating-dominated buildings are well described. Finally, the energy, economic and environmental performance of a closed-loop GCHP system is also briefly reviewed. It is found that the GSHP technology can be used both in cold and hot weather areas and the energy saving potential is significant.},

	abstract = {Ground source heat pump (GSHP) is an innovative and perspective technology able to use the ground as a thermal sink or heat source. If combined with system operating at relatively low temperature, it represents a high efficiency solution for the heating of buildings. Complementarily, during cooling operation it has a good advantage with respect to air-cooled systems, because the ground temperature is stably lower than the outdoor air one. Geothermal heat pump systems are able to reduce the environmental impact of buildings for space heating and cooling by using the ground as an energy renewable source. This paper presents a review on the GSHP systems presenting both a summary of different ground-source typologies of heat pumps and a thermodynamic approach for their modeling. The irreversible thermodynamic approach is here summarized and exposed for a complete GSHPs system. This analytical approach is particularly useful for implementing an optimization design tool for GSHP systems. Recently many works have been published about exergy analysis of these systems. Those works suggest that future lines of development may be considered: a) the optimization based on the transient performance of GSHP systems and not on the sole design condition; b) the integration of irreversible thermodynamic optimization approach into the algorithms of control systems. The diffusion of optimized GSHP systems is essential in order to reduce fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, complying with the EU's directive.},

This study applied a thermal atlas approach to map the potential for district heat networks in Switzerland. It extended existing methods with a novel approach to estimating linear thermal demand density in DHN at a national scale. DHN potential for current-generation high temperature networks as well as cutting-edge low temperature networks were compared for current building space heating and hot water demand as well as for two demand reduction scenarios. The method was tested by comparing its results to those of a local engineering study conducted for a Swiss municipality (Brig-Glis). The potential percentage of demand supplied by high temperature DHN was shown to decrease from 66\% to 41\% with energy saving while the potential for low temperature systems increased significantly from 2.1\% to 42\%. The percentage of heat demand covered by heat networks decreases less than the percentage of buildings covered, reflecting the strength of heat networks for supplying large fractions of thermal demand in geographically confined areas.},

	abstract = {This document presents a study for examining the viability of hybrid ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems that use solar thermal collectors as the supplemental component in heating dominated buildings. Loads for an actual house in the City of Milton near Toronto, Canada, were estimated. TRNSYS, a system simulation software tool, was used to model yearly performance of a conventional GSHP system as well as a proposed hybrid GSHP system. Actual yearly data collected from the site were examined against the simulation results. This study demonstrates that hybrid ground source heat pump system combined with solar thermal collectors is a feasible choice for space conditioning for heating dominated houses. It was shown that the solar thermal energy storage in the ground could reduce a large amount of ground heat exchanger (GHX) length. Combining three solar thermal collectors with a total area of 6.81m2 to a GSHP system will reduce GHX length by 15\%. Sensitivity analysis was carried out for different cities of Canada and resulted that Vancouver, with mildest climate compared to other cities, was the best candidate for the proposed solar hybrid GSHP system with a GHX length reduction to solar collector area ratio of 7.64m/m2. Overall system economic viability was also evaluated using a 20-year life-cycle cost analysis. The analysis showed that there is small economic benefit in comparing to the conventional GSHP system. The net present value of the proposed hybrid system based on the 20-year life-cycle cost analysis was estimated to be in a range of 3.7\%–7.6\% (or \$1500 to \$3430 Canadian dollar) lower than the conventional GSHP system depending on the drilling cost.},

	abstract = {The present study explores the implementation of district heating and cooling systems across a broad set of case studies reported in the literature. Topics addressed include their history, system identification, energy sources, design considerations, environmental impact, economic feasibility, performance analysis and the role of energy policy. The history of district heating and cooling systems reveals how available technology has influenced the configuration of district energy systems as more efficient and cleaner methods of providing heating and cooling have arisen. This leads to system identification based on primary energy sources, including the deployment of more and more renewable energy streams. Advantages and disadvantages of each energy source are examined in detail. Policies created by government and international entities will have a major impact on the future of research and development in district energy systems. Incentives may become necessary for creating favorable conditions for the efficient construction and utilization of district heating and cooling. Outcomes of these policies influence design considerations underlying any district energy system and their contribution in sustainability. Studies on greenhouse gas emissions along with the economic impacts of district energy construction are part of the design process and optimization of district energy systems should include economic and environmental considerations and not solely thermal efficiency. District heating and cooling systems are often integrated with components such as absorption chillers, cogeneration and thermal energy storage. Performance analysis using exergy and energy analysis have revealed several sources of irreversibility in district heating systems with these elements. If understood properly, these can greatly enhance system operation. Awareness and accommodation of the many factors discussed in this paper can improve the soundness of any district heating or cooling installation.},

To validate the model and to demonstrate structural improvement potentials, a case study for a biomass powered district heating network in Scharnhauser Park, Germany was carried out. Taking into account the existing network topology, the consumer stations were redistributed in the model in order to obtain four different load repartitions. By means of three quality indicators (the primary energy factor PEF, the relative importance of losses RiL and the CO2 emissions) it could be shown that the different geographical distributions of consumers within the network have a slight impact on the primary energy use and on the CO2 emissions of the system. The network model was also used to analyse different solar thermal energy supply strategies. It is concluded that the existing collector area can maximally contribute to 0.3\% of the total heating energy demand.},

	abstract = {The HVAC systems utilizing renewable energy sources are one of the main contributors towards the fossil fuel dependency reduction. Among these, the ground source heat pump systems, especially those based on vertical ground heat exchanger, are very attractive, due to their high efficiency. The size of the systems depends on the building (geometry, construction materials, orientation etc. but also usage and internal gains), on the ground thermophysical characteristics, on the climatology of the area and on the ground heat exchanger design and construction. As a result, the ground heat exchanger length required for heating may result significantly different from the one required for cooling. In this work, the ground heat exchanger lengths required for heating and cooling are calculated for two model-buildings, a residential and an office one, located at 40 different Greek cities, covering a wide range of country’s climate conditions. Assuming that a ratio of these lengths in the 0.8–1.2 range is required for efficient long-term operation of the autonomous GSHP system with minimum installation cost, the results suggest that autonomous systems may be used in areas with the heating degree-days in the 800–950K-days range. In hotter climates with less than 800 heating degree-days, the GSHP system should be supplemented by a conventional cooling system, while in colder climates with more than 950 heating degree-days a conventional heating system supplement is required.},

	abstract = {Growing demands for space heating and cooling make ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems a viable renewable alternative. The economic outlook of potential installations can be addressed by hybridizing GSHP systems with an auxiliary system. To better understand optimization factors in sizing hybrid GSHP systems, a series of sensitivity analyses have been performed. Using a rigorous mathematical, computational approach to size hybrid GSHP systems recently published in Alavy et al. (2013), the use of sensitivity analyses has allowed for a better determination of the impact that variations in input parameters have on the performance of GSHPs. A total of five analyses were performed to determine the effects that operating costs, inflation, geographical location within North America, and a seasonality control strategy have on sizing hybrid GSHP systems. The effects inflation of natural gas and/or electricity prices have depends on a building’s energy demands. An inflation (deflation) in electricity rates makes hybrid GSHP systems for very cooling (heating) dominant buildings more economical compared to conventional systems. Installations of smaller GSHP systems are more economical when considering time-of-use electricity rates compared to fixed electricity rates, for buildings with long operating hours during off-peak periods. However, downsizing the ground loop system causes an increase in annual operating costs which result in longer payback periods. Similarly, if a building is situated in a location with warmer weather where ground temperatures are thus higher, an optimally designed system will tend to have a shorter ground loop length. By meeting less of the building’s peak energy demands (hybrid shave factor) substantially reduces the initial costs of the ground-loop installation.},

	abstract = {Most buildings in the cold climate zone have unbalanced loads, mainly dominated by heating loads. The cold buildup within the soil would definitely reduce the soil temperature, which could consequently disturb the soil temperature balance, and furthermore, deteriorate the performance of ground source heat pump. A hybrid ground-source heat pump (HGSHP) with auxiliary heat source could be proposed to solve this problem. The paper aimed at investigating the feasibility and performance of HGSHP in Shenyang located in the cold area. Firstly, hourly dynamic loads of one office building were calculated. Then, three systems, including one HGSHP system with boiler as auxiliary heat source, ground source heat pump system (GSHP), and a traditional electric water chiller + boiler system (WB) were designed and simulated for this office building by TRNSYS. Several performance parameters for these three systems were obtained. These parameters included the hourly outlet/inlet temperature of buried pipes, hourly soil temperature, energy consumption distribution and the coefficient of performance (COP). Simulation results indicated that HGSHP system with boiler as auxiliary heat source could effectively solve cold accumulation problem and reduce traditional energy consumption. These results could provide some reference on HGSHP system utilization in the cold climate zones of China.},

A novel simulation tool for solar-assisted ground-source heat-pumps (SGSHP) is presented with an analysis of the influence of solar collectors on the improvement of heat pump performance. Solar radiation and climate temperature data of 19 European cities were used to perform simulations of SGSHP and GSHP systems considering a typical residential house. Overall performance coefficients (COPsys) varied from northern to southern locations between 4.4 and 5.8 for SGSHP and between 4.3 and 5.1 for GSHP. Results show that solar collectors coupling has more impact on performance improvement in regions that benefit from higher irradiance. However, greater running cost savings are achieved in milder climate conditions. Both heat-pump systems are able to effectively contribute to carbon footprint reductions for residential buildings, especially in countries where fossil fuels are the primary source of electricity generation. SGSHP payback periods are found between 8.5 and 23 years from northern to southern localities, making such heating system an economic heating option. SGSHPs are best suited for high irradiance and cool climate locations such as the mountainous regions in southern Europe.},

The review structure considers the market, technical, supply, environmental, institutional, and future contexts. The main global conclusions are low utilisation of district heating in buildings, varying implementation rates with respect to countries, moderate commitment to the fundamental idea of district heating, low recognition of possible carbon dioxide emission reductions, and low awareness in general of the district heating and cooling benefits. The cold deliveries from district cooling systems are much smaller than heat deliveries from district heating systems. The European situation can be characterised by higher commitment to the fundamental idea of district heating, lower specific carbon dioxide emissions, and higher awareness of the district heating and cooling benefits. The conclusions obtained from the six contexts analysed show that district heating and cooling systems have strong potentials to be viable heat and cold supply options in a future world. However, more efforts are required for identification, assessment, and implementation of these potentials in order to harvest the global benefits with district heating and cooling.},

A correct sizing for pile system is required to define the local geological, geotechnical and hydrogeological contexts. On the other hand, the thermal requirements of the building, both for heating and cooling, should be known in advance and with the best possible accuracy. From this point, different system variants can be assessed and compared, on the basis of the available foundation piles, their location, and their geometrical and thermal characteristics. The PILESIM program is based on the TRNSYS simulation program and TRNVDSTP, a non‐standard TRNSYS component devised for the simulation of ground heat storage using borehole heat exchangers or energy piles.

We have expanded and adapted the integrated assessment model TIAM-ECN to more adequately reflect geothermal energy potentials and to better represent the various sectors in which geothermal energy could possibly be used. With the updated version of TIAM-ECN, we quantify how large the share of geothermal energy in Europe could grow until 2050, and analyze how this expansion could be stimulated by climate policy and technological progress. We investigate geothermal energy’s two main applications: power and heat production. For the former, we project an increase to around 100–210 TWh/yr in 2050, depending on assumptions regarding climate ambition and cost reductions for enhanced geothermal resource systems. For the latter, with applications in residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors, we anticipate under the same assumptions a rise to about 880–1050 TWh/yr in 2050. We estimate that by the middle of the century geothermal energy plants could contribute approximately 4–7\% to European electricity generation. We foresee a European geothermal energy investment market (supply plus demand side) possibly worth about 160–210 billion US\$/yr by mid-century.},

Utilising horizontal and vertical heat collector systems, these geothermal energy sources can be harnessed for heating and cooling purposes of residential and industrial buildings. To ensure proper prediction of available potentials at landscape or even local scale, downscaling of the already existing pan-European vSGP (very shallow geothermal potential) at a scale of 1:250,000 is required. Therefore, we applied an advanced methodology to 14 European CSAs (case study areas) from which we selected two German and one Austrian area for demonstration purposes. To ensure comparability across CSAs, national and case study related datasets were standardised and harmonised. Standards and unified spatial data processing methods across CSAs ensure comparability and seamless visualisation.

	abstract = {Integration of shallow geothermal energy could effectively contribute to long-term improvement in the energy supply systems by slowing down the growth of energy consumption, changing the structure of used energy sources, and by modernizing communal energy infrastructure. Such integration is one way of addressing sustainability goals, ensuring better energy security and economic competitiveness, and making a contribution to environmental protection efforts. This paper examines the integration of local geothermal potential in the northern part of the Republic of Serbia and assesses the implications of using geothermal heat pump technology in a district heating system. This analysis considers different aspects of the proposed application and evaluates the environmental sustainability and viability of utilization of geothermal heat pumps for district heating. Energy, economic and environmental performance was assessed for infrastructure that supplies 1274 properties in collective residential building segment located in a densely populated city area. The assessment quantified performance in key energy, economic and environmental categories, focusing on the use stage of the system's life cycle. The main benefit of the geothermal heat pump system is the reduction of the inlet primary energy by at least 30\% by avoiding the use of almost a million cubic meters of natural gas per year. This also results in a competitive energy cost of 17 EUR/MWh, an investment with internal rate of return of up to 38\%, and a discounted payback period of 4.9 years. The geothermal heat pump system can bring energy and economic benefits but unfavorable environmental impacts, mainly due to the unfavorable electricity generation mix in the Republic of Serbia. The existing natural gas driven system was found to have lower impacts across all indicators but terrestrial eco-toxicity, natural land transformation and fossil depletion. In the climate change impact category, the existing system's impacts are 82\% lower than those of the geothermal system.},

To guarantee a sustainable use it is therefore necessary to consider environmental and technical criteria, such as changes in groundwater quality and temperature. In the current study a comprehensive overview of consequences of geothermal systems in shallow aquifers is provided. We conclude that there is still a lack of knowledge on long-term environmental consequences. Due to local differences in geology and hydrogeology as well as in technical requirements, it is not recommendable to define only static regulations, such as fixed and absolute temperature thresholds. Flexible temperature limits for heating and cooling the groundwater and subsurface are therefore advisable. The limits should be oriented on previously undisturbed temperatures, and chemical, physical and biological conditions of aquifers. Based on these findings, recommendations for a sustainable policy for shallow geothermal systems are provided including a potential legal framework for a sustainable use.},

For this purpose, a new methodology is introduced enhancing and utilizing a methodology previously introduced by the same authors for designing hybrid GSHP systems [Alavy et al., Renewable Energy 57 (2013) 404–412]. The new methodology is applied to a utility model of heating and cooling for 100 different commercial buildings, in which a utility or private company installs a larger hybrid GSHP system and then distributes heating or cooling to buildings via a common water loop. The methodology proposed in the present study automatically computes the savings potential associated with thousands of possible building combinations to perform a statistical analysis on the value and potential of the utility model for heating and cooling. It is shown that the methodology can result in reducing the net present value (NPV) of total costs (up to 50\%), increasing the potential savings, and still meeting a significant amount of the buildings' heating and cooling demands. This study also shows that for a desired value of NPV savings, increasing the number of buildings combined is only valuable until a certain threshold (which depends on location, weather, building type and building size), after which adding additional buildings to the combinations is not worthwhile. It is also shown that some buildings, for which installing a GSHP system was totally uneconomical, lend themselves particularly well to the utility model and in return, can benefit from a more environmentally friendly geothermal source of heating and cooling.},

	abstract = {The building sector is highly sensitive to climate change, where energy is used for numerous purposes such as heating, cooling, cooking and lighting. Space heating and cooling account for a large proportion of overall energy use, and the associated energy demand is also affected by climate change. Here, we project the economic impact of changes in energy demand for space heating and cooling under multiple climatic conditions. We use an economic model coupled with an end-use technology model to explicitly represent the investment costs for air-conditioning technologies, which influence the macroeconomy. We conclude that the negative effects on the economy from increases in the use of space cooling are sufficiently large to neutralize the positive impacts from reductions in space heating usage under climate change, which results in significant economic loss. The economic loss under the highest emissions scenario (RCP8.5) would correspond to a −0.34\% (−0.39\% to −0.18\%) change in global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2100 compared with GDP without any climate change, while the impact under the lowest emissions scenario (RCP2.6) would result in a −0.03\% (−0.07\% to −0.01\%) change in global GDP in 2100. The economic losses are mainly generated by incremental technological costs and not by changes in energy demand itself. The amount of economic loss can vary substantially based on assumptions of technological costs, population and income. To reduce the negative impacts of climate change measures for reducing the costs of air conditioning will be an important consideration for the building sector in the future.},

In a reference scenario, global energy demand for heating is projected to increase until 2030 and then stabilize. In contrast, energy demand for air conditioning is projected to increase rapidly over the whole 2000–2100 period, mostly driven by income growth. The associated CO2 emissions for both heating and cooling increase from 0.8GtC in 2000 to 2.2GtC in 2100, i.e. about 12\% of total CO2 emissions from energy use (the strongest increase occurs in Asia). The net effect of climate change on global energy use and emissions is relatively small as decreases in heating are compensated for by increases in cooling. However, impacts on heating and cooling individually are considerable in this scenario, with heating energy demand decreased by 34\% worldwide by 2100 as a result of climate change, and air-conditioning energy demand increased by 72\%. At the regional scale considerable impacts can be seen, particularly in South Asia, where energy demand for residential air conditioning could increase by around 50\% due to climate change, compared with the situation without climate change.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades Europe experienced a series of high-impact heat extremes. We here assess observed trends in temperature extremes at ECA\&D stations in Europe. We demonstrate that on average across Europe the number of days with extreme heat and heat stress has more than tripled and hot extremes have warmed by 2.3 °C from 1950–2018. Over Central Europe, the warming exceeds the corresponding summer mean warming by 50\%. Days with extreme cold temperatures have decreased by a factor of 2–3 and warmed by more than 3 °C, regionally substantially more than winter mean temperatures. Cold and hot extremes have warmed at about 94\% of stations, a climate change signal that cannot be explained by internal variability. The clearest climate change signal can be detected in maximum heat stress. EURO-CORDEX RCMs broadly capture observed trends but the majority underestimates the warming of hot extremes and overestimates the warming of cold extremes.},

	abstract = {A theoretical and experimental study has been carried out for a residential brine-to-water CO2 heat pump system for combined space heating and hot water heating. A 6.5kW prototype heat pump unit was constructed and extensively tested in order to document the performance and to study component and system behaviour over a wide range of operating conditions. The CO2 heat pump was equipped with a unique counter-flow tripartite gas cooler for preheating of domestic hot water (DHW), low-temperature space heating and reheating of DHW. The CO2 heat pump was tested in three different modes: space heating only, DHW heating only and simultaneous space heating and DHW heating. The heat pump unit gave off heat to a floor heating system at supply/return temperatures of 33/28, 35/30 or 40/35°C, and the set-point temperature for the DHW was 60, 70 or 80°C. Most tests were carried out at an evaporation temperature of −5°C, and the average city water temperature was 6.5°C. The experimental results proved that a brine-to-water CO2 heat pump system may achieve the same or higher seasonal performance factor (SPF) than the most energy efficient state-of-the-art brine-to-water heat pump systems as long as: (1) the heating demand for hot water production constitutes at least 25\% of the total annual heating demand of the residence, (2) the return temperature in the space heating system is about 30°C or lower, (3) the city water temperature is about 10°C or lower and (4) the exergy losses in the DHW tank are small.},

System alternative 1 is profitable with daily net metering and monthly net metering and unprofitable with instantaneous net metering.

	abstract = {Heating electrification powered by distributed renewable energy generation is considered among potential solutions towards mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Roadmaps propose a wide deployment of heat pumps and photovoltaics in the residential sector. Since current distribution grids are not designed to accommodate these loads, potential benefits of such policies might be compromised. However, in large-scale analyses, often grid constraints are neglected. On the other hand, grid impact of heat pumps and photovoltaics has been investigated without considering the influence of building characteristics. This paper aims to assess and quantify in a probabilistic way the impact of these technologies on the low-voltage distribution grid, as a function of building and district properties. The Monte Carlo approach is used to simulate an assortment of Belgian residential feeders, with varying size, cable type, heat pump and PV penetration rates, and buildings of different geometry and insulation quality. Modelica-based models simulate the dynamic behavior of both buildings and heating systems, as well as three-phase unbalanced loading of the network. Additionally, stochastic occupant behavior is taken into account. Analysis of neighborhood load profiles puts into perspective the importance of demand diversity in terms of building characteristics and load simultaneity, highlighting the crucial role of back-up electrical loads. It is shown that air-source heat pumps have a greater impact on the studied feeders than PV, in terms of loading and voltage magnitude. Furthermore, rural feeders are more prone to overloading and under-voltage problems than urban ones. For large rural feeders, cable overloading can be expected already from 30\% heat pump penetration, depending on the cable, while voltage problems start usually at slightly higher percentages. Additionally, building characteristics show high correlations with the examined grid performance indicators, revealing promising potential for statistical modeling of the studied indicators. Further work will be directed to the assessment of meta-modeling techniques for this purpose. The presented models and methodology can easily incorporate other technologies or scenarios and could be used in support of policy making or network design.},

	abstract = {The emergence of renewable-energy-source (RES) envelope solutions, building retrofit requirements and advanced energy technologies brought about challenges to the existing paradigm of urban energy systems. It is envisioned that the building cluster approach—that can maximize the synergies of RES harvesting, building performance, and distributed energy management—will deliver the breakthrough to these challenges. Thus, this paper aims to critically review urban energy systems at the cluster level that incorporate building integrated RES solutions. We begin with defining cluster approach and the associated boundaries. Several factors influencing energy planning at cluster scale are identified, while the most important ones are discussed in detail. The closely reviewed factors include RES envelope solutions, solar energy potential, density of buildings, energy demand, integrated cluster-scale energy systems and energy hub. The examined categories of RES envelope solutions are (i) the solar power, (ii) the solar thermal and (iii) the energy-efficient ones, out of which solar energy is the most prevalent RES. As a result, methods assessing the solar energy potentials of building envelopes are reviewed in detail. Building density and the associated energy use are also identified as key factors since they affect the type and the energy harvesting potentials of RES envelopes. Modelling techniques for building energy demand at cluster level and their coupling with complex integrated energy systems or an energy hub are reviewed in a comprehensive way. In addition, the paper discusses control and operational methods as well as related optimization algorithms for the energy hub concept. Based on the findings of the review, we put forward a matrix of recommendations for cluster-level energy system simulations aiming to maximize the direct and indirect benefits of RES envelope solutions. By reviewing key factors and modelling approaches for characterizing RES-envelope-solutions-based urban energy systems at cluster level, this paper hopes to foster the transition towards more sustainable urban energy systems.},

	abstract = {Several studies have found that the decrease of photovoltaic (PV) cell temperature would increase the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Different working fluids such as air and water have been used for the cooling of PV modules, but the improvement in energy performance has been found to be small. In this paper, R134a refrigerant was employed to cool the PV modules. With its low evaporating temperature, it was expected to achieve better cooling effect and electrical performance of the PV modules than using air and water working fluids. An experimental rig of a hybrid micro PV panel-based heat pump system was constructed for the performance testing in a laboratory at the University of Nottingham. A small PV panel was made of 6 glass vacuum tube – PV module – aluminium sheet – cooper tube (GPAC) sandwiches connected in series, acting as the evaporator. This was coupled with a small heat pump system. The glass vacuum tubes reduced the heat loss from the PV panel to the ambient, resulting in the improvement of thermal performance. Three testing modes were proposed to investigate the effect of solar radiation, condenser water flow rate and condenser water supply temperature on energy performance. The testing results showed that an averaged COP reached 3.8, 4.3 and 4.0 under the three testing modes with variable radiation, condenser water supply water temperature and water flow rate, respectively, but this could be much higher for a large capacity heat pump system using large PV panels on building roofs. The COP increased with the increasing solar radiation, but decreased with the increasing condenser water supply temperature and water flow rate. The electrical efficiency of PV panel was improved by up to 1.9\% based on a reference PV efficiency of 3.9\%, compared with that without cooling. The condenser water supply temperature and water flow rate had little effect on the electrical performance.},

A reference system with two different energy storage technologies is investigated in this paper. One system with 48kWh of batteries and one system with a hot water storage tank where the electricity is stored as heat. The research questions in this paper are: Which storage system gives the highest level of PV electricity self-consumption? Are the storage systems profitable with the assumptions made in this paper? What are the levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) for the reference system with different storage system? The system with batteries has a self-consumption of 89\% of the annual PV-electricity output and the system with a hot water storage tank has 88\%. The system with batteries has a levelized cost of electricity two times higher than the system with a hot water storage tank.},

The radiant wall works as a thermal storage system (TES) allowing storage of the PV output and, thus, peak load shifting. However, the management of these technologies is complex due to the dynamics of the system. This paper presents several control concepts with different purposes such as shifting energy use to off-peak periods, maximizing self-consumption of PV output, and minimization of imported energy from the grid. An experimentally validated numerical model from previous research was used to investigate and compare the different proposed control concepts. Results showed that charging the wall with solar energy resulted in higher overall energy use of the heat pump, while the imported grid energy was significantly reduced, thanks to self-consumption.},

	abstract = {This article reports investigations of a residential building in Serbian conditions energized by electricity from photovoltaics (PVs), and the electricity grid. The building uses electricity to run its space heating system, lighting and appliances, and to heat domestic hot water (DHW). The space heating system comprises floor heaters, a water-to-water heat pump, and a ground heat exchanger. The PV system generates electricity that either may be consumed by the building or may be fed-in the electricity grid. The electricity grid is used as electricity storage. Three residential buildings are investigated. The first residential building has PVs that yearly produce smaller amount of electricity than the heating system requires. This is a negative-net energy building (NNEB). The second building has the PVs that produce the exact amount of electricity that the entire building annually needs. This is a zero-net energy building (ZNEB). The third building has PVs that entirely cover the south-facing roof of the building. This is a positive-net energy building (PNEB). These buildings are presented by a mathematical model, partially in an EnergyPlus environment. For all buildings, simulations by using EnergyPlus software would give the generated, consumed, and purchased energy with time step, and monthly and yearly values. For sure, these buildings would decrease demand for electricity during summer, however they will increase this demand during winter when there is no sun and start of space heating is required. Depending on the size of PV array this building will be either NNEB, or ZNEB, or PNEB. However it is crucial for such a building to be connected to the electricity grid. The smaller payback for investment in the PV array is obtained for buildings with larger size of PV array. The feed-in tariff for the generation of electricity in Serbia should be under the constant watch to be corrected accordingly for larger penetration of this technology in the Serbian market.},

	abstract = {Already in prehistoric times humans took advantage of the steady temperature inside the earth, by using caves or
holes in the ground to store food or to live inside, both in cold and warm climates. However, making active use
of this thermal energy reservoir in the underground required a tool for changing temperature, the heat pump.
Practical application of the heat pump process was already done in the 19th century, with the example of the
steam generation in Ebensee salt works in Austria by Peter von Rittinger, and the first claims on a heat pump
extracting heat from the earth were made by H. Zoelly in a Swiss patent as early as 1912. However, the first
documented Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) application in practice dates from 1945, in Indianapolis, USA,
and in Europe the first reports on ground-source heat pumps are from the 1960s.
R\&D on geothermal heat pumps had a first boom in the 1950s in USA and Canada, and after the first oil price
crisis in 1973, it started in Europe and Japan, and resumed in North America. The paper gives some details on
the R\&D-activities from the 1980s on and on the related work in IEA-cooperation. Some findings from that time
are highlighted, as well as steps towards guidelines and standards, and examples of milestones in practical
application are given. An assessment of the current status, both in technical development and market, and some
cautious expectations for future development will complete the presentation.},

Five different combinations of solar assisted ground source heat pump (SAGSHP) are simulated for a residential building in the city of Zahedan, Iran. Modeling, simulation, and operation controlling have been performed in TRNSYS software and the coefficient of performance (COP), electrical power consumption of the GSHP, soil temperature, as well as building and domestic hot water temperatures for 10 years of operation have been obtained and compared. It is obtained that a 12kW GSHP with the assisted flat solar collectors can supply space heating demand and DHW for the building throughout the winter. The maximum and minimum annual mean COP values are 3.75 and 3.52, respectively. In the best scenario for the system assisted with the solar collector, the energy consumption diminishes 8.7\% compared to GSHP standalone system.},

With current developments in energy efficiency of new and renovated buildings, and the coupling of heating and electricity demand through heat pumps, the long-term load forecast cannot be based on its historic pattern anymore. This paper presents part of an on-going work aimed at improving forecasts of the electric load profile on a national level, based on a bottom-up approach. The proposed methodology allows to account for energy efficiency measures of buildings and introduction of heat pumps on the aggregated electric load profile. Based on monitored data from over 100 non-residential buildings from all over Norway, with hourly resolution, this paper presents panel data regression models for heat load and electric specific load separately. This distinction is crucial since it allows to consider future energy efficiency measures and substitution of heating technologies. The data set is divided into 7 building types, with two variants: regular and energy efficient. The load is dependent on hour of the day, outer temperature and type of day, such as weekday and weekend. The resulting parameter estimates characterize the energy signature for each building type and variant, normalized per floor area unit (m2). Hence, it is possible to generate load profiles for typical days, weeks and years, and make aggregated load forecasts for a given area, needing only outdoor temperature and floor areas as additional data inputs.},

The aim of this work is to investigate the optimal transformation strategies for buildings and districts to reach CO2 emission reduction targets for the Swiss building stock, to support policies and decision makers in developing new energy regulations for the future. A simulation approach is developed, which combines clustering methods, to define representative buildings and districts, with multi-objective optimization to investigate the optimal set of building and district measures to minimize costs and CO2 emissions. Results at building level show that the most economical measures for reaching emission targets for the future include roof retrofitting and window replacement together with PV installation. In terms of heating systems, biomass or heat pumps seem to be the most favourable option. The analysis of district archetypes shows that district level solutions are mainly applicable to urban communities, whereas building level solutions are clearly the optimal solution for rural areas.},

	abstract = {The use of shallow geothermal energy increasingly receives attention as a suitable alternative to fossil fuel-based space heating and cooling, warm water provision, as well as for seasonal heat storage throughout Europe. With the advent of shallow geothermal energy use on large scales, a vivid discussion of potential ecological and economic impacts has arisen but actual field data are scarce. An intensive groundwater temperature-monitoring program over a period of 3 years with consecutive measurements was, therefore, initiated at a residential neighborhood in the city of Cologne, Germany, under intense shallow geothermal use. The aim of the monitoring program was to overcome the existing data scarcity by pinpointing the effects of the intensive thermal use of the subsurface on groundwater temperatures and to foster understanding of urban groundwater temperature evolution. Results show that even though energy demands of the individual houses and energy extraction rates of the shallow geothermal systems were comparably small in this case, the accumulation of shallow geothermal users had a measurable impact on overall groundwater temperatures.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the optimal configuration of PV and electricity storage in a detailed representation of the Swiss power system. The sensitivity of storage deployment with respect to distribution network capacity is also investigated. We propose an open-source dispatch model to optimise the electricity supply of Switzerland and its four neighbouring countries with hourly time resolution. Moreover, our representation of the Swiss power system includes various types of consumers, namely, the residential (single-family house and multi-family house), service and industrial sectors, with a differentiation by rural, suburban and urban settings, resulting in 12 sub-national nodes. We then use monitored electricity demand load data for each sector. We find that the achievement of the Swiss federal target of 13.8 GWp PV capacity by 2050, which corresponds to 30\% of the annual production, requires an additional storage capacity of 11 GWh (corresponding to 1.6 h of average consumption) in order to minimise total costs. However, when letting the optimisation model choose both the PV capacity and the size of energy storage, then minimal costs are achieved by a system with 24.6 GWp of PV (corresponding to 53\% of the annual production) combined with 29.2 GWh (4.1 h of average consumption) of storage capacity. Our results show that storage plays an important role in minimising the total cost for energy systems with large PV capacity as well as satisfying the distribution capacity constraints. The detailed results and mechanisms at the level of sub-national nodes are discussed. The model and the methodology presented in this study with a focus the Swiss case can be applied to any country/region.},

	abstract = {Underground urbanization aids sustainability by contributing to the optimization of land use plans, diversification of urban functions, safeguarding of utility supplies and enrichment of social life. Underground space as a valuable land resource can be integrated into a general urban resources management scheme and development policy, by rationalizing resource supply according to economic demand, and by coordinating stakeholders from the public administration, private developers and users. After benchmarking best practices in administration and management, from seven cities (Helsinki, Singapore, Hong Kong, Minneapolis, Tokyo, Shanghai and Montreal), critical success factors are extracted to guide a pilot project implementation. The way to incorporate underground space planning into conventional urban planning process is exemplified by a pilot project of Suzhou City in China, which investigated thoroughly the supply potential of its underground space resource as well as the demand potential of the urban economy on underground space development. The core value of the case study in Suzhou City is based on active involvement of provincial and municipal governments, who supported territorial data collection, administrative consultation and the development of GIS-based decision-making tools. The typicality of the present case study refers to an old Chinese city with a modern Central Business District owning important economic functions for the Yangtze region. Underground Space in Suzhou City is considered as a new land resource manageable with a quantitative and spatial inventory for future allocation. An economic model putting forward a “3D land value” index will be illustrated for underground building projects. This index helps to regulate underground space development according to the resource supply potential and economic demand potential. This strategic framework including potential analysis, local implementation and instrumental innovation was developed from an international cooperation program named “Deep City project” between Switzerland and China. Further discussions on considering societal impacts affected by underground space use indicate future research directions for underground space operations management.},

The physical constraints affecting groundwater thermal management policies are described as a basis for a later proposal of an approval process protocol for new shallow geothermal installations. The policy proposed for this process is based on numerical modeling and a relaxation factor which reserves a fraction of shallow geothermal energy resources for possible third party installations thus preventing its monopolization. The policy is then applied to simulate a concession process in a real urban groundwater body highly affected by ground source heat pumps. A calibrated numerical groundwater flow and heat-transport model has been utilized for the evaluation of the thermal response of the aquifer to a new projected installation and the thermal interference risk associated. The results obtained from the protocol application have proven its practical value in the sustainable management of shallow geothermal energy resources and in ensuring stakeholders water rights. In addition, a specific policy impact indicator was derived that should be of interest for numerical water policy assessment initiatives.},

Long-term simulated wind power time series are therefore an essential component for understanding the temporal availability of wind power and its integration into future renewable energy systems. In the recent past, mainly power curve based models such as Renewables.ninja (RN) have been used for deriving synthetic time series for wind power generation despite their need for accurate location information as well as for bias correction, and their insufficient replication of extreme events and short-term power ramps. We assess how time series generated by machine learning models (MLM) compare to RN in terms of their ability to replicate the characteristics of observed nationally aggregated wind power generation for Germany. Hence, we apply neural networks to one MERRA2 reanalysis wind speed input dataset with no location information and one with basic location information. The resulting time series and the RN time series are compared with actual generation. Both MLM time series feature equal or even better time series quality than RN depending on the characteristics considered. We conclude that MLM models can, even when reducing information on turbine locations and turbine types, produce time series of at least equal quality to RN.},

	abstract = {Electrifying the energy system with heat pumps and battery electric vehicles (BEV) is a strategy of Switzerland and many other countries to reduce CO2 emissions. A large electrification, however, poses several new challenges for the electricity system, particularly in combination with a simultaneous substitution of nuclear power plants (NPP) by volatile renewables such as photovoltaics (PV). In this study, these challenges in terms of additional electricity demands, deficits and surpluses as well as effective CO2 mitigation are assessed in a dynamic and data-driven approach. To this end, electricity demand and production profiles are synthesized based on measured data and specifications and assumptions of the key technologies at a high temporal resolution. The additional electricity demand of heat pumps is estimated from hourly measured heat demand profiles of a Swiss district heating provider, while for BEV different recharging patterns are combined. For electricity production, NPP are deducted from the current electricity production profile, while PV is added at an hourly resolution. In order to estimate CO2 emissions, life-cycle analysis (LCA) CO2 intensities of the different technologies are used. It is shown that with a BEV and heat pump penetration of 20\% and 75\%, respectively, there is an almost 25\% (13.7 TWh/year) increase of the electricity demand and\&mdash;just as challenging\&mdash;an additional maximum power requirement of 5.9 GWh/h (hourly-averaged power). Without additional storage options, large amounts of electricity must be imported in winter and at night, while in summer at noon there is a large surplus from PV. Due to their high CO2 intensities\&mdash;at least for the next decades\&mdash;electricity imports and PV may\&mdash;depending on the reference scenario (with or without NPP) and assumptions on other key parameters\&mdash;even offset the overall CO2 savings of a highly electrified Swiss energy system.},

	abstract = {This work focuses on methods to characterise the efficiency losses in existing ground-source heat pump (GSHP) installations under part-load conditions. Efficiency losses were identified and quantified in a GSHP by analysing key parameters measured and recorded by its monitoring system. The heating/cooling production facility comprises a vertical borehole heat exchanger field and a GSHP equipped with a double parallel stage and fixed-speed compressors within. The methodology was based on the EN-14825 standard and other recent works. However, the particularity of having two parallel stages motivated the creation of a modified theoretical approach, since the original methodology was only applicable to single-stage heat pumps. To obtain significant results, minute-resolved data acquired over time periods with almost constant thermal load (quasi-steady state conditions) proved necessary. The study concluded that the coefficient of performance can suffer reductions as high as 9\% exclusively due to part-load operation. Most importantly, it demonstrated that the actual capacity of the GSHP as a whole shows an effective reduction ranging between 20\% and 24\% with respect to the declared capacity of the heat pump alone. Moreover, weekly-averaged data collected during 3 complete cool and warm seasons point to a progressive degradation from the date of commissioning. Finally, Ground Loop Design software (v2016) was used to validate the methodology. Consistent agreement was found between simulated and measured seasonal performance.},

	abstract = {The temperature at a certain depth in the ground remains nearly constant throughout the year and the ground capacitance is regarded as a passive means of heating and cooling of buildings. To exploit effectively the heat capacity of the ground, a heat-exchanger system has to be constructed. This is usually an array of buried pipes running along the length of a building, a nearby field or buried vertically into the ground. A circulating medium (water or air) is used in summer to extract heat from the hot environment of the building and dump it to the ground and vice versa in winter. A heat pump may also be coupled to the ground heat exchanger to increase its efficiency. In the literature, several calculation models are found for ground heat exchangers. The main input data are the geometrical characteristics of the system, the thermal characteristics of the ground, the thermal characteristics of the pipe and the undisturbed ground temperature during the operation of the system. During the first stages of the geothermal systems study, one-dimensional models were devised which were replaced by two-dimensional models during the 1990s and three-dimensional systems during recent years. The present models are further refined and can accommodate for any type of grid geometry that may give greater detail of the temperature variation around the pipes and in the ground. Monitoring systems have been set up to test various prototype constructions with satisfactory results.},

	abstract = {An overview is presented on the last decade of geothermal heating by ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) in Europe. Significant growth rates can be observed and today's total number of GSHP systems is above 1 million, with an estimate of about 1.25 million mainly used for residential space heating in 2011. These systems are counted among renewable energy technologies, though heat pump operation typically consumes electricity and thus only a fraction of the energy produced is actually greenhouse gas (GHG) emission free. Consequently, only in the most mature markets of the Scandinavian countries and in Switzerland, calculated emission savings reach more than 1\% compared to standard heatings. However, Sweden shows that more than 35\% is possible, with about one third of these systems in Europe concentrated in this country. Our calculations demonstrate the crucial role of country-specific heating practices, substituted heat mix and primary electricity mix for country-specific emission savings. For the nineteen European countries studied in 2008, 3.7Mio t CO2 (eq.) are saved in comparison to conventional practice, which means about 0.74\% on average. This reveals that many countries are at an early stage with great potential for the future, but even if the markets would be fully saturated, this average would barely climb to about 30\%. These numbers, however, take the current conditions as reference, and when extrapolated to the future can be expected to improve by greener electricity production and increased heat pump performance.},

Thermal Use of Shallow Groundwater introduces the theoretical fundamentals of heat transport in groundwater systems, and discusses the essential thermal properties. It presents a complete overview of analytical and numerical subsurface heat transport modeling, providing a series of mathematical tools and simulation models based on analytical and numerical solutions of the heat transport equation. It is illustrated with case studies from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland of urban thermal energy use, and heat storage and cooling. This book gives a complete set of analytical solutions together with MATLAB® computer codes ready for immediate application or design. It offers a comprehensive overview of the state of the art of analytical and numerical subsurface heat transport modeling for students in civil or environmental engineering, engineering geology, and hydrogeology, and also serves as a reference for industry professionals.},

This deviation is the sum of two effects: atmospheric global warming and urban heating. To invert the temperature profiles (T-logs), a novel analytical model is presented to distinguish effects of global warming and of urban structures on the ground thermal regime. The inversion is demonstrated on four characteristic T-logs measured in the city and suburbs of Zurich, Switzerland. The logging was performed in borehole heat exchanger U-tubes by an innovative, wireless measuring technique. Detailed information on past climatic and land use changes enabled the focus on two main urban heat sources, buildings and asphalt. For three of the locations, the T-logs could be reproduced with a plausible heating of the asphalt by 3–3.5°C, and an average temperature of 15–16°C below the basement of buildings. However, the other location within the highly urbanized area, is influenced by additional heat sources. In most of the cases, the increased subsurface temperatures and the associated stored additional geothermal energy, mainly originate from urban structures, while climate change is secondary.},

Then, the concept of system integration of heating and power is examined presenting its merits and challenges. The second part of the study focuses on the assessment of two clean transitions pathways of the heating sector, namely electrification of heat and efficient heat and power production and district heating network.

To date, the lack of high-resolution building and environmental data and the large uncertainties related to existing processing methods impede the accurate estimation of large-scale rooftop PV potentials. To address this gap, we developed a methodology that combines Machine Learning algorithms, Geographic Information Systems and physical models to estimate the technical PV potential for individual roof surfaces at hourly temporal resolution. We further estimate the uncertainties related to each step of the potential assessment and combine them to quantify the uncertainty on the final PV potential. The methodology is applied to 9.6 million rooftops in Switzerland and can be transferred to any large region or country with sufficient available data. Our results suggest that 55\% of the total Swiss roof surface is available for the installation of PV panels, yielding an annual technical rooftop PV potential of 24±9TWh. This could meet more than 40\% of Switzerland’s current annual electricity demand. The presented method for an hourly rooftop PV potential and uncertainty estimation can be applied to the large-scale assessment of future energy systems with decentralised electricity grids. The results can be used to propose effective policies for the integration of rooftop photovoltaics in the built environment.},

It extends quantitative measures from city planning, network science, ecosystems studies, fractal geometry, statistical physics, and information theory to the analysis of urban form and qualitative human experience. Metrics at multiple scales are scattered throughout diverse bodies of literature and have useful applications in analyzing the adaptive complexity that both evolves and results from local design processes. In turn, they enable urban designers to assess resilience, adaptability, connectedness, and livability with an advanced toolkit. The typology developed here applies to empirical research of various neighborhood types and design standards. It includes temporal, visual, spatial, scaling, and connectivity measures of the urban form. Today, prominent urban design movements openly embrace complexity but must move beyond metaphor and inspiration to formalize what "complexity" is and how we can use it to assess both the world as-is as well as proposals for how it could be instead.},

Various studies in the ﬁeld of urban planning and design have given recommendations on “good urban form”, suggesting that especially characteristics of the urban morphology inform the quality of locations and additionally inﬂuence spatial behavior. While we ﬁnd a growing number of quantitative spatial models such as hedonic price models, location choice models, or applied machine learning algorithms, characteristics describing the urban morphology are still rarely reported in these. One reason can be found in the limited knowledge on how to characterize the urban morphology best. In this chapter, we address this deﬁcit and deﬁne attributes that are suitable to characterize the urban morphology in quantitative means at different scales. We show how these can be processed from a data model that is simple enough to allow for reproducibility in most study areas and process them for the case study of Switzerland. Finally, we use the attributes to deﬁne urban typologies through clustering methods. These are compared on their outcome, their consistency, and interpretation.},

In this paper we present a method to support the description and prescription of urban form that is contextsensitive, multi-dimensional, systematic, exploratory, and quantitative, thus facilitating the application of urban typomorphology to planning practice. At the core of the proposed method is the k-means statistical clustering technique to produce objective classifications from the large complex data sets typical of urban environments. Block and street types were studied as a test case and a context-sensitive sample of types that correspond to two different neighbourhoods were identified. This method is suitable to support the identification, understanding and description of emerging urban forms that do not fall into standard classifications. The method can support larger urban form studies through consistent application of the procedures to different sites. The quantitative nature of its output lends itself to integration with other systematic procedures related to the research, analysis, planning and design of urban areas.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated urban built-up areas can be derived from nighttime light satellite (DMSP-OLS) images at the national or continent scale. This paper presents a novel object-based method for detecting and characterizing urban spatial clusters from nighttime light satellite images automatically. First, urban built-up areas, derived from the regionally adaptive thresholding of DMSP-OLS nighttime light data, are represented as discrete urban objects. These urban objects are treated as basic spatial units and quantified in terms of geometric and shape attributes and their spatial relationships. Next, a spatial cluster analysis is applied to these basic urban objects to form a higher level of spatial units – urban spatial clusters. The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is used to represent spatial proximity relationships among urban objects. An algorithm based on competing propagation of objects is proposed to construct the MST of urban objects. Unlike previous studies, the distance between urban objects (i.e., the boundaries of urban built-up areas) is adopted to quantify the edge weight in MST. A Gestalt Theory-based method is employed to partition the MST of urban objects into urban spatial clusters. The derived urban spatial clusters are geographically delineated through mathematical morphology operation and construction of minimum convex hull. A series of landscape ecologic and statistical attributes are defined and calculated to characterize these clusters. Our method has been successfully applied to the analysis of urban landscape of China at the national level, and a series of urban clusters have been delimited and quantified.},

	abstract = {Currently, debates over urban form have generally focused on the contrast between the “sprawl” often seen as typical of the United States and “compact” urban forms found in parts of Europe. Although these debates are presumed to have implications for developing worlds as well, systematic comparison of urban forms between developed and developing countries has been lacking. This paper utilized satellite images of 77 metropolitan areas in Asia, US, Europe, Latin America and Australia to calculate seven spatial metrics that capture five distinct dimensions of urban form. Comparison of the spatial metrics was firstly made between developed and developing countries, and then among world regions. A cluster analysis classifies the cities into groups in terms of these spatial metrics. The paper also explored the origins of differences in urban form through comparison with socio-economic developmental indicators and historical trajectories in urban development. The result clearly demonstrates that urban agglomerations of developing world are more compact and dense than their counterparts in either Europe or North America. Moreover, there are also striking differences in urban form across regions.},

Urban planning can influence urban form, but due to practicality needs to focus on a few indicators out of the numerous indicators which are available. The present study analyses urban form with respect to landscape metrics and population-related indicators for 231 European cities. Correlations and factor analysis identify the most relevant urban form indicators. Furthermore, a cluster analysis groups European cities according to their urban form. Significant differences between the clusters are presented. Results indicate that researchers, European administration and urban planners can select few indicators for analysing urban form due to strong relationships between single indicators.

Here we explore the relation between various compactness indicators and solar potential in the 16 neighbourhoods (11,418 buildings) constituting the city of Geneva (Switzerland). The solar potential is assessed for building integrated photovoltaics (BiPV), solar thermal collectors (STC), and direct gain passive solar systems. The hourly solar irradiation on each of the building surfaces over one year period is calculated using CitySim simulations, while taking the effects of irradiation threshold for roof and facades into account. With increasing compactness, the annual solar irradiation decreases from 816 to 591 kWh m−2. When passing from dispersed to compact neighbourhoods, the BiPV potential (given as percentage of total area) for facades decreases from 20\% to 3\%, the STC potential from 85\% to 49\%, and the passive solar heating potential from 21\% to 4\%, whereas for roofs the BiPV potential decreases from 94\% to 79\% and the STC potential from 100\% to 95\%. The solar potential for roofs, therefore, is much less affected than that for facades by the compactness. The results should be of great help for urban-form energy optimisation and building retrofitting interventions.},

	abstract = {Evaluating ground surface temperature (GST) is common in applied and general geothermal research. Our main focus here is investigating GST for Switzerland because of its well-known impact on low-enthalpy resources, like borehole heat exchanger (BHE) utilization. Using mainly meteorological data, we determined the present-day GST distribution through different approaches. First, we analyzed the actual GST data from the last 20 years measured at the meteorological stations of the Swiss Meteorological Institute (SMI) by investigating recent climatic history and annual variation behavior. Recent climate change seems to have a higher impact on Alpine regions than on the Alpine Foreland. Next, we determined the GST altitude dependence in the range of 200–1800 m a.s.l., using nonlinear fitting approaches and investigated the relationship between GST and surface exposure. Contrary to previous publications, no universal correlation between GST and surface exposure was found, due to local and rapid changing meteorological conditions. Finally, we used a complete data set to consider meteorologically relevant data like soil moisture, wind speed, and vegetation cover and height. The measured GST was well reproduced for the case of low vegetation, except when covered by snow and for days of subzero surface air temperature (SAT). Other locations like urban areas could not be tested. Due to the complexity of physical interaction and the resulting assessment of large data sets, this approach is not suitable for determining regional GST distribution which we need as an input for BHE modeling. A relationship between GST and SAT was defined based on the data from the meteorological stations. By applying nonlinear approaches, we established three different altitude zones that require individual consideration. By further processing, an existing SAT map was converted into the first GST map of Switzerland. To verify this new map within the range of validity (up to altitudes of 1500 m a.s.l.), GST values extrapolated from boreholes were used as independent data sources. Generally, a fit with a standard deviation of ±1.0 K was achieved, but local deviations of 2 K also occurred. The new GST map of Switzerland provides useful estimates of regional GST, but not for local effects. It represents an important improvement in evaluating geothermal resources and determines regional GST distribution under vegetation and weather conditions typical of central Europe.},

	abstract = {Geothermal energy is an efficient low carbon solution for the heating and cooling of buildings. For many megacities such as London and Beijing, the amount of energy that can be stored in the urban local subsurface is greater than their annual heating and cooling demands. The ground source heat pump (GSHP) system – a shallow geothermal technology that provides heating and cooling for buildings by continuously replenishing the energy in the subsurface – has been used increasingly in recent years, but its application has been generally limited to single buildings. In this study, a geographic information system-based simulation model was developed to estimate how many GSHPs could be installed at the city scale without losing control of the ground thermal capacity and to evaluate the degree to which such a system could contribute to the energy demands of buildings in a city. The model was built by embedding a Python-based GSHP design code into ArcGIS software and was trialled on the City of Westminster, a borough in London, UK, as a case study under the two scenarios of boreholes placed under buildings and boreholes around buildings. Under both scenarios, the model produced borehole allocation maps and ratio of capacity to demand maps. The results show that a large proportion of buildings could support their own heating demands through GSHPs and, through a well-organised district heating system, GSHPs may be used efficiently to satisfy heating demands throughout an urban area.},

The methodology is simple and inexpensive because it can take advantage of the prescriptive geotechnical drilling prior to the construction of a house or building, to take at the same time temperature measurements that will allow get the actual temperature and ground thermal diffusivity to the depth of interest.

An alternative to non-renewable energy-based heat supply is the implementation of closed and open shallow geothermal systems, such as horizontal ground source heat pump systems, vertical ground source heat pump (vGSHP) systems and groundwater heat pump systems. Based on existing regulations and local hydrogeological conditions, the optimal site-specific system for heat supply has to be identified. In the presented technical feasibility study, various analytical solutions are tested for an urban quarter before and after building refurbishment. Geothermal heat supply rates are evaluated by providing information on the optimal system and the specific shortcomings. Our results show that standard vGSHP systems are even applicable in older and non-refurbished residential areas with a high heat demand using a borehole heat exchanger with a length of 100 m or in conjunction with multiple boreholes. After refurbishment, all studied shallow geothermal systems are able to cover the lowered heat demand. The presented analysis also demonstrates that ideally, various technological variants of geothermal systems should be evaluated for finding the optimal solution for existing, refurbished and newly developed residential areas.},

	abstract = {Subsurface temperature data is usually only accessible as point information with a very limited number of observations. To spatialize these isolated insights underground, we usually rely on interpolation methods. Unfortunately, these conventional tools are in many cases not suitable to be applied to areas with high local variability, like densely populated areas, and in addition are very vulnerable to uneven distributions of wells. Since thermal conditions of the surface and shallow subsurface are coupled, we can utilize this relationship to estimate shallow groundwater temperatures from satellite-derived land surface temperatures. Here, we propose an estimation approach that provides spatial groundwater temperature data and can be applied to natural, urban, and mixed environments. To achieve this, we combine land surface temperatures with anthropogenic and natural processes, such as downward heat transfer from buildings, insulation through snow coverage, and latent heat flux in the form of evapotranspiration. This is demonstrated for the city of Paris, where measurements from as early as 1977 reveal the existence of a substantial subsurface urban heat island (SUHI) with a maximum groundwater temperature anomaly of around 7 K. It is demonstrated that groundwater temperatures in Paris can be well predicted with a root mean squared error of below 1 K by means of satellite-derived land surface images. This combined approach is shown to improve existing estimation procedures that are focused either on rural or on urban conditions. While they do not detect local hotspots caused by small-scaled heat sources located underground (e.g., sewage systems and tunnels), the findings for the city of Paris for the estimation of large-scale thermal anomalies in the subsurface are promising. Thus, the new estimation procedure may also be suitable for other cities to obtain a more reliable insight into the spatial distribution of urban ground and groundwater temperatures.},

A new volumetric method-based approach is proposed for evaluating shallow geothermal potential by combining microtremor survey results. Parameters such as thickness of clay and sandy gravel layers can be achieved by processing the microtremor ﬁled data. The study area was divided into grids based on the different exploration sites. The heat present in each small unit was calculated using the revised volumetric method. This division into small units improved the accuracy of assessment of the geothermal potential and helped plot the distribution map of the available heat amount, which indicated optimal locations for development and utilization of shallow geothermal resources. Jimo, China was used as an example to depict the calculation ﬂow. Since the microtremor survey method can identify the thickness of clay, sandy gravel, and fresh bedrock layers in shallow ground, the amount of shallow geothermal resources present above fresh bedrock was calculated. In Jimo, the amount of exploitable geothermal resources, using the traditional volumetric method, was found to be 4.92 Â 1012 kJ. The proposed calculation method not only provided a higher corresponding value of 6.96 Â 1012 kJ but also showed the regions with the highest potential of shallow geothermal resources. Hence, this approach provides an alternative method for geothermal potential assessment which can be used globally.},

In this work, six studies carried out in Switzerland are compared in a quantitative way, in order to understand how different methods impact the potential estimates. We observe a strong trend towards increasing spatial and temporal resolutions, using larger and more accurate datasets for the analysis. While the earliest study relies on rules of thumb, later studies use data-driven estimations, enabled by the use of Machine Learning, scalable algorithms and powerful computational engines. Our analysis shows that the largest differences are caused by the source of the solar radiation input data, the computation of shading effects on rooftops and the estimation of available roof area for PV panel installation. The latter is the most uncertain parameter in the presented studies and offers opportunities for future work.},

The goal of this research was to develop a methodology for estimating the uncertainty in PV yield predictions and to identify avenues for reducing this uncertainty. In this case study, uncertainties were estimated to be about 3.9\% for year-to-year climate variability, 5\% for long-term average horizontal insolation, 3\% for estimation of radiation in the plane of the array, 3\% for power rating of modules, 2\% for losses due to dirt and soiling, 1.5\% for losses due to snow and 5\% for other sources of error. Uncertainties due to ageing and system availability were also considered. By performing statistical simulations with the Solar Advisor Model software, it was found that the combined uncertainty (standard deviation) is approximately 8.7\% for the first year of operation, and 7.9\% for the average yield over the PV system lifetime. While these numbers could vary significantly from one system to the next, the methodology developed is widely applicable. Moreover, a simpler methodology was also explored which should yield quick and fairly reliable estimates of uncertainty. Finally, avenues for reducing yield uncertainties were identified, including: increasing the reliability and resolution of solar radiation estimates, including measurements of irradiance in non-horizontal planes at high quality ground stations, reducing the uncertainty in module ratings and investigating losses that have not been well documented such as those due to dirt, soiling and snow.},

	abstract = {This article covers a comparative analysis of the potentials and constraints of diﬀerent heat sources (air, geothermal boreholes, lake, river, groundwater and solar thermal) exploited by HP systems, implemented in various types of multifamily buildings (MFB) – new, retroﬁtted and non-retroﬁtted – which correspond to real case studies situated in Geneva. After characterizing the various heat sources and building demands, as well as presenting the numerical model and adopted sizing values, we study the intrinsic potential of the various HP heat sources and show that the HP seasonal performance factor (SPF) is directly correlated to the heat source temperature. In a further step we consider complementary PV production for the HP system, taking into account the available roof area and daily proﬁle match. For buildings with a combined space heating and domestic hot water heat demand up to 80 kWh/m2, which correspond to current best case buildings (10\% of the existing MFB stock in Geneva), combined HP \& PV systems should lead to an annual purchased electricity inferior to 15 kWh/ m2 (with a factor 2 between best and worst heat sources), with an associated daily peak load up to 150 Wh/m2/ day. For a demand below 130 kWh/m2 (which is the case of 75\% of the existing MFB stock of the Canton), the various combinations of HP \& PV systems mainly result in a purchased electricity below 45 kWh/m2. The daily peak load reaches up to 500 Wh/m2/day, or eventually higher in the case of high-rise buildings. Aside from the ﬁnal purchased electricity, the annual electricity injected into the grid is in the order of 15–20 kWh/m2 for lowrise buildings, and half that much for high-rise buildings (except for solar HP systems, for which the reduced available roof area for PV leads to signiﬁcantly lower values). Lastly, SPF alone is not a suﬃcient indicator for the characterization of the HP system performance, since it doesn’t reﬂect the absolute value of the electricity demand, which primarily depends on the building heat demand. Furthermore, both SPF and annual electricity demand are limited to annual balance considerations. As a complement, an indication of the peak electricity load gives valuable indications of the potential stress on the grid.},

Using the MM5/CALMET model simulated wind data of Hong Kong, the FAD map of three urban zones are calculated: podium (0–15 m), building (15–60 m), and urban canopy (0–60 m). The wind tunnel test data is used to correlate the FAD understanding of the three zones. The grid sensitivity test indicates that 200 m × 200 m is the reasonable resolution for the FAD map; the test also establishes that the lower urban podium zone yields the best correlation with the experimental data. The study further establishes that the simpler two-dimensional ground coverage ratio (GCR), which is readily available in the planning circle, can be used to predict the area’s average pedestrian level urban ventilation performance of the city. Working with their inhouse GIS team using available data, it allows the planners a way to understand the urban ventilation of the city for decisions related to air paths, urban permeability and site porosity.},

Yet, details are missing on how to track progress towards the ‘Paris goal’, inform the five-yearly ‘global stocktake’, and increase the ambition of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We develop a nested structure of key indicators to track progress through time. Global emissions2,3 track aggregated progress1, country-level decompositions track emerging trends4,5,6 that link directly to NDCs7, and technology diffusion8,9,10 indicates future reductions. We find the recent slowdown in global emissions growth11 is due to reduced growth in coal use since 2011, primarily in China and secondarily in the United States12. The slowdown is projected to continue in 2016, with global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry similar to the 2015 level of 36 GtCO2. Explosive and policy-driven growth in wind and solar has contributed to the global emissions slowdown, but has been less important than economic factors and energy efficiency. We show that many key indicators are currently broadly consistent with emission scenarios that keep temperatures below 2 °C, but the continued lack of large-scale carbon capture and storage13 threatens 2030 targets and the longer-term Paris ambition of net-zero emissions.},

Nevertheless, a single ELM is unstable in data classification. The Bagging-based ensemble classifier, i.e., Bagging-ELM has been studied popularly and proved to improve the performance of ELM significantly in terms of accuracy, however, it is inappropriate to deal with large-scale datasets due to the highly intensive computation. In this study, we propose a novel ELM ensemble classifier, namely b-ELM, which leverages the Bag of Little Bootstraps technique to obtain a scalable, efficient means of classification for large-scale data. Efficiency of classification is achieved as it only requires repeated training under consideration on quantities of data that can be much smaller than the original training data. Furthermore, b-ELM is suited to implementation on modern parallel and distributed computing platforms. The experimental results demonstrate that b-ELM can efficiently handle large-scale data with a good performance on prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {In mountain regions, the distribution of surface air temperature happens to show marked horizontal gradients and nonlinear variations with topographic height. These pose a major challenge for the construction of area-wide temperature datasets on a regular grid. This study introduces a new deterministic method's for the spatial interpolation of daily temperature from station measurements. Building on a scale-separation concept, the methods main features are (1) a nonlinear parametric function to model nonlinearities in the vertical thermal profile at the scale of major basins, and (2) a distance weighting scheme with a non-Euclidean metric that accounts for terrain effects on the spatial representativity of measurements. The method is configured for the territory of Switzerland (European Alps) and is applied for the construction of a km-scale grid dataset from 70-100 stations over all days from 1961 to 2010. Several illustrative cases attest the method's potential, also under challenging conditions. Temperature patterns from basin-scale inversions and surface heated/cooled boundary layers are realistically reproduced. In situations with valley-scale cold-air pools and foehn, the method is less prone to artificial upslope/downslope extrapolation often observed with other techniques. With a network of 100 stations in Switzerland, typical interpolation errors (mean absolute error MAE, cross-validation) range from 0.5 °C over flat and hilly terrain in summer to 1.5 °C in the Alps in winter. Larger and partly systematic errors (MAE ≥ 3 °C) must be expected in un-sampled valleys in winter due to the missing out of local-scale cold pools. Interpolation accuracy was found to vary with the change in station density over time, demonstrating improvements in the overall representativity of the measurement network. But this also compromises the long-term homogeneity of the grid dataset, despite it being based on homogeneous records. The presented method may be applicable in other mountain regions after some configuration.},

To do so, we quantify the potential of three choices for PV installations that increase production during the winter months when electricity is most needed. These are placements that favor (i) high winter irradiance, (ii) high ground-reflected radiation, and (iii) steeper-than-usual panel tilt angles. In addition to spatial estimates of the production potential, we compare the performance of different PV placement scenarios in urban and mountain environments for the country of Switzerland. The results show that the energy deficit in a future fully renewable production from wind power, hydropower, and geothermal power could be significantly reduced when solar PV is installed at high elevations. Because the temporal production patterns match the typical demand more closely than the production in urban environments, electricity production could be shifted from summer to winter without reducing the annual total production. Such mountain installations require significantly less surface area and, combined with steeper panel tilt angles, up to 50\% of the winter deficit in electricity production can be mediated.},

The model is designed to calculate the monthly average hourly global radiation in the tropics with high aerosol load. This model represents a physical relation between the earth-atmospheric albedo derived from GMS5 satellite data and the absorption and scattering coefficients of various atmospheric constituents. The absorption of solar radiation by water vapour which is important for the tropics, was calculated from ambient temperature and relative humidity. The relationship between the visibility and solar radiation depletion due to aerosols was developed for a high aerosol load environment. This relationship was used to calculate solar radiation depletion by aerosols in the model. The total column ozone from TOMS/EP satellite was employed for the determination of solar radiation absorbed by ozone. Solar radiation from four pyranometer stations was used to formulate the relationship between the satellite band earth-atmospheric albedo and broadband earth-atmospheric albedo required by the model. To test its performance, the model was used to compute the monthly average hourly global radiation at 25 solar radiation monitoring stations in tropical areas in Thailand. It was found that the values of monthly average of hourly global radiations calculated from the model were in good agreement with those obtained from the measurements, with the root mean square difference of 10\%. After the validation the model was employed to generate hourly solar radiation maps of Thailand. These maps reveal the diurnal and season variation of solar radiation over the country.},

However, because of laborious acquisition workﬂows they are more difﬁcult to obtain than LoD1 models and are thus less prevalent in practice. This paper explores whether the type of the roof of a building can be inferred from semantic LoD1 data, potentially leading to their free upgrade to LoD2, in a broader context of a workﬂow for their generation without aerial campaigns. Inferring rooftop information has also other uses: quality evaluation and veriﬁcation of existing data, supporting roof reconstruction, and enriching LoD0/LoD1 data with the attribute of the roof type. We test a random forest classiﬁer that analyses several attributes of buildings predicting the type of the roof. Experiments carried out on the 3D city model of Hamburg using 12 attributes achieve an accuracy of 85\% in identifying the roof type from sparse data using a multiclass classiﬁcation. The performance of binary classiﬁcation hits the roof: 92\% accuracy in predicting whether a roof is ﬂat or not. It turns out that the two most useful variables are footprint area and building height (i.e. LoD1 models without any semantics, or LoD0 with such information), and using only them also yields relatively accurate results.},

Some of the scenarios resulted in surprisingly good performance (given the circumstances): we have achieved a mean absolute error of 0.8m in the inferred heights, which satisfies the accuracy recommendations of CityGML for LOD1 models and the needs of several GIS analyses. We show that our method can be used in practice to generate 3D city models where there are no elevation data, and to supplement existing datasets with 3D models of newly constructed buildings to facilitate rapid update and maintenance of data.},

Ground source heat pump (GSHP) system is a technology that transfers heat stored over long periods to/from the ground to heat/cool the buildings. In particular, a vertical closed loop GSHP is a viable choice in densely populated urban areas. In this study, an ArcGIS-based simulation model has been developed to examine how many vertical closed loop GSHPs can be feasibly installed at city scale without overusing the geothermal energy underground. City of Westminster, in London, is used as a case study to identify and map areas where GSHPs can serve as a viable option for heating and/or cooling. A parametric study has been conducted to investigate the influence of how space heating and cooling demand is quantified on the potential utility of GSHP systems. The influence of COP variation during operation is also examined. The operational variation of COP influences the electricity consumption of the GSHP systems. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis including the capital cost, C/D ratio distribution, energy demand, and financial risk is highly recommended for district-level planning of GSHP systems.},

However, there exists no general procedure for quantifying the low-temperature geothermal potential in urban ground and groundwater. This review categorizes previous work based on different definitions of the geothermal potential and compares the different assessment methods used. It is demonstrated that the theoretical potential of the available heat at a shallow depth is enormous, especially when not only the heat in place, but also compensating heat fluxes are considered. The technical potential describes the extractable heat by a specific technology. The methods to evaluate the extractable heat are manifold, including the use of technical performance standards, analytical and numerical simulation tools and mathematical regression procedures. These are different for groundwater well based open-loop systems and heat-exchanger-based closed loop systems, and the results depend on variable local factors, the density of systems applied and whether heat and/or cold is utilized. We contrast the published findings based on the power density and the relative contribution to the demand of a city. The broad span of the results highlights the need for a more consistent framework that distinguishes between the conceptual assumptions for calculating the technical geothermal potential and the local city-specific factors. This will be the basis for a reliable analysis of the economic geothermal potential of low-temperature geothermal applications on a local, district or city scale. This will also enhance the reliability and the trust in these technologies, and thus the public acceptance reflected in the acceptable geothermal potential.},

	abstract = {The growing interest in shallow geothermal resources leads to dense installation areas, where interference and decrease in efficiency might occur. To optimize geothermal use in cities which prevents interference between neighbouring and future installations, we present a novel concept relying on the definition of thermal protection perimeters (TPP) around geothermal installations. These perimeters are determined by quantifying the thermal probability of capture around closed- and open-loop geothermal systems. Then, the maximal acceptable power that can be exploited in the vicinity of the installations can be continuously mapped. Existing analytical heat transport models are adapted to calculate these thermal capture probabilities. Two applications are illustrated in Lyon (France). The first application shows that adapted analytical models can help to manage multiple geothermal installations already in place in sectors of few square kilometres. In the second application, a numerical deterministic model is used to determine the TPP of one open-loop system at a local scale. The numerical approach applied for this case allows to account for flow disturbances caused by underground constructions, and thus offers a refined representativeness of the probability of capture. The presented methodology facilitates compatibility assessments between existing and planned new geothermal installations, which is otherwise not feasible by only mapping thermal plumes caused by existing installations, as done in common practice.},

Therefore, we present an accessible and simple methodology to define the maximum potential that can be extracted and the position of the exploitations with the objective of limiting the thermal impacts to the available space. The proposed method, named T-I-GER, takes into account the hydraulic and thermal properties of the subsurface as well as the size and orientation of the owner's plot. All this information is integrated in two different graphs: the thermal characteristic curve and the thermal plume graph. Therefore, the installer is able to graphically define the maximum potential and to check that thermal influences are restricted to the plot area. We show with a hypothetical application in Azul city, Argentina, that the maximum extraction potential from similar plots can vary depending on the orientation of the plots with respect to groundwater flow. In the plots where the major dimension is parallel to groundwater flow, the maximum potential can be approximately twice the potential of the perpendicular plots.},

If heat extraction and injection is not seasonally balanced, thermal anomalies grow in the ground. These are commonly constrained by regulations and not desirable due to potential decline of the system’s performance. We demonstrate, for the case with heat extraction and only partial replenishment, how adjustment of seasonal heating and cooling workloads can mitigate local cooling of the ground. It is revealed that the benefit from mathematical optimization increases with heat extraction/injection imbalance. Evidently, strategic operation of individual BHEs in the field can to some extent compensate for the heat injection deficit. Additionally to the optimization of workloads, we inspect the required number of BHEs for a given heating/cooling demand. The idea is that by sequentially removing least effective BHEs in the field, investment cost are reduced, while the effect on the entire field performance is minimal. We show that such unfavorable BHEs exist mainly in non-optimized fields without replenishment. Thus, our work offer two ways of tuning BHE fields applied for geothermal heating and cooling: workload optimization of individual BHEs and removal of redundant BHEs for a given arrangement.},

To determine the geothermal potential, Ground Source Heat Exchanger (GSHE) coupled with heat pump was used to supply a fixed demand equivalent to the energy required to heat a Chilean standard house. The main barrier for the implementation of a GSHE coupled with heat pump is the well drilling cost, therefore the potential is presented as meters to be drilled in order to install 2 types of GSHE: 1) Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE) and 2) Groundwater Heat Exchanger (GWHE). To assess the BHE, we used specific Heat Extraction (sHE) of sediments. To evaluate a GWHE, we used depth of groundwater table and groundwater drawdown caused by pumping water to the heat pump. The depth to be drilled ranges from 35 to 105 m in case of the BHE, while in case of the GWHE it ranges from 10 to 400 m.},

The performance of these systems is dependent on a series of factors, among which the thermal properties of the soil play a major role. The purpose of this paper is to present, in an integrated manner, the main methods and procedures to assess ground thermal properties for SGE systems and to carry out a critical review of the methods. In particular, laboratory testing through either steady-state or transient methods are discussed and a new synthesis comparing results for different techniques is presented.

The urbanisation effect on the peak heating and peak cooling capacity of groundwater in a cold groundwater region was investigated. Groundwater temperatures were measured and energy potentials calculated from three partly urbanised aquifers situated between the latitudes of 60° 25′N and 60° 59′N in Finland. The average groundwater temperature below the zone of seasonal temperature fluctuations was 3–4 °C higher in the city centres than in the rural areas. The study demonstrated that due to warmer groundwater, approximately 50–60 \% more peak heating power could be utilized from populated areas compared with rural areas. In contrast, approximately 40–50 \% less peak cooling power could be utilised. Urbanisation significantly increases the possibility of utilising local heat energy from groundwater within a wider region of naturally cold groundwater. Despite the warming in urban areas, groundwater still remains attractive as a source of cooling energy. More research is needed in order to determine the long-term energy capacity of groundwater, i.e. the design power, in urbanised areas of cold regions.},

This paper presents a new methodology to provide a response to the need for a regional quantification of the geothermal potential that can be extracted by BHEs and the associated environmental impacts. A set of analytical solutions facilitates accurate calculation of the heat exchange of BHEs with the ground and its environmental impacts. For the first time, advection and dispersion heat transport mechanisms and the temporal evolution from the start of operation of the BHE are taken into account in the regional estimation of shallow geothermal resources. This methodology is integrated in a GIS environment, which facilitates the management of input and output data at a regional scale. An example of the methodology's application is presented for Barcelona, in Spain. As a result of the application, it is possible to show the strengths and improvements of this methodology in the development of potential maps of low temperature geothermal energy as well as maps of environmental impacts. The minimum and maximum energy potential values for the study site are 50 and 1800W/m2 for a drilled depth of 100m, proportionally to Darcy velocity. Regarding to thermal impacts, the higher the groundwater velocity and the energy potential, the higher the size of the thermal plume after 6months of exploitation, whose length ranges from 10 to 27m long. A sensitivity analysis was carried out in the calculation of heat exchange rate and its impacts for different scenarios and for a wide range of Darcy velocities. The results of this analysis lead to the conclusion that the consideration of dispersion effects and temporal evolution of the exploitation prevent significant differences up to a factor 2.5 in the heat exchange rate accuracy and up to several orders of magnitude in the impacts generated.},

	abstract = {Many cities leave a considerable thermal footprint in the subsurface. This is caused mainly by accelerated heat fluxes from warmed basements, pavements and buried infrastructures. Even though rough estimations of the theoretical heat content in urban ground exist, there is no insight available on the technical potential of such subsurface urban heat islands. By considering borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) for geothermal exploitation, new opportunities arise for planning sustainable systems within cities through utilization of accelerated ground heat input from urban structures. This is feasible at moderate heat extraction rates even without any active (seasonal) recharging of the BHEs. For typical conditions in central Europe and a given system’s life time, each additional degree of urban ground heating could save around 4 m of the borehole length for the same heating power supply. We inspect implications for a single BHE as well as complete coverage of cities, which is approximated by an infinite field of BHEs. The results show that shallower systems favour renewable operation, and urban technical potential of geothermal use increases by up to 40\% when compared to rural conditions.},

Very small changes of temperature with depth in the upper 250 m are related to heat gained by the subsurface due to recent global warming. Temperature data compiled from precise temperature logs in equilibrium wells, and temperature time series from a network of meteorological stations, allow calculation of the available heat energy for heating in the cold period and for cooling in peak warm months. Utilization of this energy resource has the potential for significant CO2 reduction in Canada. The geothermal energy stored in the ground can be used, with the help of heat pumps, for heating, given very low winter temperatures. The amount of potential heat available is vast. In Canada, south of permafrost border, the integrated value of potentially available heat during the heating season down to −50 m is 1.1 E21 J (1100 quads).},

The economic and technical suitability of this technology strongly depends on the thermal and hydrogeological properties of the ground at the installation site, which need to be assessed in detail. A common indicator adopted to define such suitability is the geothermal potential, i.e. the thermal power that can be exchanged with the ground through a GSHP with a certain setup. In this paper, we present the assessment and mapping of the shallow geothermal potential in the province of Cuneo, a 6900 km2 wide county in NW Italy. Geological, hydrogeological and climatic information are collected and processed to estimate the relevant ground properties. The shallow geothermal potential is then estimated with different methods for closed-loop installations (Borehole Heat Exchangers, BHEs) and open-loop installations (Ground Water Heat Pumps, GWHPs) systems in order to identify the most suitable areas for different technologies. The maps of the geothermal potential are an important planning tool for the installation of GSHPs and for the growth of this renewable energy source.},

	abstract = {This article covers a comparative analysis of the potentials and constraints of diﬀerent heat sources (air, geothermal boreholes, lake, river, groundwater and solar thermal) exploited by HP systems, implemented in various types of multifamily buildings (MFB) – new, retroﬁtted and non-retroﬁtted – which correspond to real case studies situated in Geneva. After characterizing the various heat sources and building demands, as well as presenting the numerical model and adopted sizing values, we study the intrinsic potential of the various HP heat sources and show that the HP seasonal performance factor (SPF) is directly correlated to the heat source temperature. In a further step we consider complementary PV production for the HP system, taking into account the available roof area and daily proﬁle match. For buildings with a combined space heating and domestic hot water heat demand up to 80 kWh/m2, which correspond to current best case buildings (10\% of the existing MFB stock in Geneva), combined HP \& PV systems should lead to an annual purchased electricity inferior to 15 kWh/ m2 (with a factor 2 between best and worst heat sources), with an associated daily peak load up to 150 Wh/m2/ day. For a demand below 130 kWh/m2 (which is the case of 75\% of the existing MFB stock of the Canton), the various combinations of HP \& PV systems mainly result in a purchased electricity below 45 kWh/m2. The daily peak load reaches up to 500 Wh/m2/day, or eventually higher in the case of high-rise buildings. Aside from the ﬁnal purchased electricity, the annual electricity injected into the grid is in the order of 15–20 kWh/m2 for lowrise buildings, and half that much for high-rise buildings (except for solar HP systems, for which the reduced available roof area for PV leads to signiﬁcantly lower values). Lastly, SPF alone is not a suﬃcient indicator for the characterization of the HP system performance, since it doesn’t reﬂect the absolute value of the electricity demand, which primarily depends on the building heat demand. Furthermore, both SPF and annual electricity demand are limited to annual balance considerations. As a complement, an indication of the peak electricity load gives valuable indications of the potential stress on the grid.},

In this paper, we develop a spatial model to determine the potential per parcel for using shallow geothermal energy, for space heating and hot water. The method is based on the space heating and hot water energy demand of each building and the specific heat extraction potential of the subsurface per parcel. With this information, along with the available space per parcel for boreholes, the percentage of the energy demand that could be supplied by geothermal energy is calculated. The potential reduction in CO2 emissions should all possible geothermal energy be utilised, is also calculated. The method is applied to Ludwigsburg, Germany. It was found that CO2 emissions could potentially be reduced by 29.7\% if all space heating and hot water requirements were provided by geothermal energy, which would contribute to the sustainability of a city. The method is simple in execution and could be applied to other cities as the data used should be readily available. Another advantage is the implementation into the web based Smart City Energy platform which allows interactive exploration of solutions across the city.},

The Low Temperature Geothermal Energy has already gained attention as a renewable energy resource for domestic heating and represents a growing opportunity for investment. Although it is common practice to conduct an accurate evaluation of the geothermal potential and its exploitability on a site during the construction of a single installation, there is not an established practice or guidelines for estimating this resource over large territories. This information could support an institution’s ability to conduct regional energy planning and guide private entrepreneurship to meet new economic opportunities. To address these issues, the main contribution of this work is a model that reduces the distance between the physical knowledge of the territory/environment and economic analysis. The model is based on a useful assessment of low temperature geothermal potential obtained from physical parameters on a regional scale, from which a set of economic indicators are calculated to evaluate the actual economic accessibility to the geothermal energy resource.},

In this study, the effect of distance between boreholes on heat transfer rate per unit borehole length (unit HTR value) is computationally investigated. Four different configurations consisting of 2, 3, 5 and 9 boreholes are considered. 3 and 6 months averaged unit HTR value of the most critical borehole in each configuration is compared with that of single borehole to determine the performance loss. Variations of performance loss due to thermal interactions of boreholes with both time and distance are analyzed. Furthermore, the effects of thermal conductivity of ground on temperature distributions around borehole is also examined. Results can be used to determine the optimal borehole distance for various applications.},

	abstract = {The optimal design and operation of an integrated building energy system consisting of the renewable energy technologies such as ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) and solar thermal collectors, etc., is an important problem to be addressed. This paper describes a methodology for the optimization of a building energy system including a detailed thermal model of a borehole heat exchanger based GSHP. The novelty of this model is that it enables the study of dynamic temperature changes within the ground during operation. Furthermore, a model of solar thermal collectors is also included, which enables the study of solar regeneration of the ground in the short and long-term. Additionally, seven scenarios of building envelope retrofit are evaluated alongside optimal system design solutions. The methodology uses a bi-level multi-objective optimization approach, which consists of a genetic algorithm at the design level, and a mixed integer linear program at the operation level, in order to minimise the total costs and CO2 emissions. The methodology is applied to a single-family residential building in Zurich, Switzerland, in order to demonstrate its application and analyse the design and operation of the system, with special attention to the GSHP. The results indicate that in the short-term, the ground temperature reduces considerably, to almost 5 °C as compared to the initial temperature of 11.5 °C. Furthermore, solar regeneration due to excess heat in summer increases the temperature back above initial temperature. However, due to due to insufficient regeneration in the long-term, the ground temperature drops consistently to almost 4 °C at the end of 20 years of operation. On the demand-side, window retrofitting results in a 27.3\% reduction in the total CO2 emissions at almost no additional costs. Retrofitting the whole building including windows, walls, roofs, and floors, is a CO2 optimal solution however, performs worst in terms of cost optimality.},

Furthermore, the presence of neighbouring BHEs adds to the cooling effect, thereby reducing the overall geothermal energy potential. Due to these restrictions, it is important to consider spatial constraints and the thermal interference from neighbouring BHEs when evaluating the geothermal energy potential of urban areas. In this paper, a methodology to calculate the long-term geothermal energy potential for an urban neighbourhood is developed. A GIS based workflow is used to design the BHEs for multiple buildings, in order to satisfy their total heating/cooling demands with consideration of spatial constraints. A model that accounts for thermal interference between neighbouring BHEs is developed in order to simulate their operation and calculate their long-term geothermal energy potential. The method is applied to an urban neighbourhood in Zurich, Switzerland with 170 buildings. Results show that the geothermal energy potential is overestimated if thermal interference between BHEs are not accounted for. A long-term declining trend is observed in the geothermal energy potential due to ground cooling.},

Realising this potential raises challenges at policy and electricity system planning level. To address this, the authors have developed a geospatially explicit methodology using up-to-date spatial information of the EU building stock to quantify the available rooftop area for PV systems. To do this, it combines satellite-based and statistical data sources with machine learning to provide a reliable assessment of the technical potential for rooftop PV electricity production with a spatial resolution of 100 m across the European Union (EU). It estimates the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) using country-specific parameters and compares it to the latest household electricity prices. The results show that the EU rooftops could potentially produce 680 TWh of solar electricity annually (representing 24.4\% of current electricity consumption), two thirds of which at a cost lower than the current residential tariffs. Country aggregated results illustrate existing barriers for cost-effective rooftop systems in countries with low electricity prices and high investment interest rates, as well as provide indications on how to address these.},

Here we assess the effect of current INDCs on reducing aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, its implications for achieving the temperature objective of the Paris climate agreement, and potential options for overachievement. The INDCs collectively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to where current policies stand, but still imply a median warming of 2.6–3.1 degrees Celsius by 2100. More can be achieved, because the agreement stipulates that targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are strengthened over time, both in ambition and scope. Substantial enhancement or over-delivery on current INDCs by additional national, sub-national and non-state actions is required to maintain a reasonable chance of meeting the target of keeping warming well below 2 degrees Celsius.},

A basic tool for the analysis is the solution for a heat-extraction step. The thermal disturbance at and near the ground surface is shown to be negligible. Thermal recharge in order to improve the heat-extraction capacity a few months later is shown to be futile. The thermal processes in the borehole are, in good approximation, represented by a single borehole resistance. Formulae that relate the heat-extraction rate to the required extraction temperatures are given. They are based on superpositions of steady-state, periodic, and extraction-step solutions. A response-test method is proposed for the determination of three important parameters: average thermal conductivity in the ground, borehole thermal resistance, and average undisturbed ground temperature.},

	abstract = {The deployment of geothermal energy systems can significantly contribute to climate change mitigation and play a part in the transition to a low carbon society. This study proposes a framework for identifying the shallow geothermal energy potential of new individual and district heating (DH) systems. The model accounts for thermal interference between neighbouring wells and borehole heat exchangers, where the main criteria for analysis are ground temperature, thermal conductivity, heat flow, and heat capacity. The paper presents a cost-effective area method for the identification of potential new DH areas, while considering the cost competitiveness of the heat supplied. Economic potential is determined based on the cost-effectiveness of the competing technologies, separately for urban and rural areas. The results show that although 54\% of technical DH potential in Slovenia remains untapped, the future of shallow geothermal energy systems lies predominantly in individual systems, which have proven to be the most cost efficient solution on locations with favourable geological or hydro-geological conditions. Where possible, shallow geothermal energy can contribute from 2\% to 25\% of energy for heat production in analysed existing fossil fuel based DH systems, thus making shallow geothermal energy suitable for supplying base load power in an economical manner.},

We created maps showing the potential for this technique provided by the thermal underground properties. Therefore, we established an underground model for two study areas in south-western Germany with different geological settings using a geographic information system (GIS). The subsurface has been divided into layers with similar thermal properties based on geological, hydrogeological and lithological information. The layers have been attached with specific heat extraction values, according to the German VDI guideline 4640. For depths of 50 and 100m, the weighted mean value of the specific heat extraction was calculated and presented within maps.

	abstract = {The very shallow geothermal potential (vSGP) is increasingly recognized as a viable resource for providing clean thermal energy in urban and rural areas. This is primar‑ily due to its reliability, low-cost installation, easy maintenance, and little constraints regarding ground-related laws and policies. We propose a methodology to extract the theoretical vSGP (installed in the uppermost 10 m of the ground, and mostly at depths of 1–2 m) at the national scale for Switzerland, based on a combination of Geographic Information Systems, traditional modelling, and machine learning (ML). The theoreti‑cal vSGP is based on the estimation of three thermal characteristics of the ground that impact significantly the geothermal potential, namely the monthly temperature at vari‑ous depths in the surface layer, the thermal conductivity, and the thermal diffusivity. Each of the three variables is estimated separately, to a depth of 1 m below the surface, using the following general strategy: (1) collect significant data related to the variable, (2) if not existing, extract values for the variable at available locations with the help of traditional models and part of the data as input for these models, (3) train a ML model (with the Random Forests algorithm) using the extracted variable values as examples (training output labels) and related information contained in the data as features (train‑ing input samples), (4) use the trained ML model to estimate the variable in unknown locations, (5) estimate the uncertainty attached to the estimations. The methodology estimates values for (200 × 200) ­(m2) pixels forming a grid over Switzerland. The strat‑egy, however, can be generalized to any country with significant data (topographic, weather, and surface layer/soil data) available. The results indicate a very non-negligible potential for very shallow geothermal systems in Switzerland.},

Before forecasting the solar systems output, it is essential to focus the prediction on the solar irradiance. The global solar radiation forecasting can be performed by several methods; the two big categories are the cloud imagery combined with physical models, and the machine learning models. In this context, the objective of this paper is to give an overview of forecasting methods of solar irradiation using machine learning approaches. Although, a lot of papers describes methodologies like neural networks or support vector regression, it will be shown that other methods (regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting and many others) begin to be used in this context of prediction. The performance ranking of such methods is complicated due to the diversity of the data set, time step, forecasting horizon, set up and performance indicators. Overall, the error of prediction is quite equivalent. To improve the prediction performance some authors proposed the use of hybrid models or to use an ensemble forecast approach.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic generation of electricity is an important renewable energy source, and large numbers of relatively small photovoltaic systems are proliferating around the world. Today it is widely acknowledged by power producers, utility companies and independent system operators that it is only through advanced forecasting, communications and control that these distributed resources can collectively provide a firm, dispatchable generation capacity to the electricity market. One of the challenges of realizing such a goal is the precise forecasting of the output of individual photovoltaic systems, which is affected by a lot of factors. This paper introduces our short-term solar irradiance forecasting algorithms based on machine learning methodologies, Hidden Markov Model and SVM regression. A series of experimental evaluations are presented to analyze the relative performance of the techniques in order to show the importance of these methodologies. The Matlab interface, the Weather Forecasting Platform, has been used for these evaluations. The experiments are performed using the dataset generated by Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The experimental results show that our machine learning based forecasting algorithms can precisely predict future 5–30 min solar irradiance under different weather conditions.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing has become the most important data source for the digital elevation model (DEM) generation. DEM analyses can be applied in various fields and many of them require appropriate DEM visualization support. Analytical hill-shading is the most frequently used relief visualization technique. Although widely accepted, this method has two major drawbacks: identifying details in deep shades and inability to properly represent linear features lying parallel to the light beam. Several authors have tried to overcome these limitations by changing the position of the light source or by filtering. This paper proposes a new relief visualization technique based on diffuse, rather than direct, illumination. It utilizes the sky-view factor—a parameter corresponding to the portion of visible sky limited by relief. Sky-view factor can be used as a general relief visualization technique to show relief characteristics. In particular, we show that this visualization is a very useful tool in archaeology as it improves the recognition of small scale features from high resolution DEMs.},

	abstract = {Global radiation measured on fixed-tilt, south-facing planes (40° and vertical) and a 2-axis tracker at NREL’s Solar Radiation Research Lab. in Golden, CO is compared to predictions from ten transposition models, in combination with either optimal or suboptimal input data of horizontal irradiance. Suboptimal inputs are typically used in everyday engineering calculations, for which the necessary data are usually unavailable for the site under scrutiny, and must be estimated in some way. The performance of the transposition models is first evaluated for ideal conditions when optimal data are used. In this specific case, it is found that the Gueymard and Perez models provide the best estimates of global tilted irradiance under clear skies in particular. The performance of four direct/diffuse separation models is also evaluated. Their predictions of direct and diffuse radiation appear biased in most cases, with a model-dependent magnitude. Finally, the performance of the resulting combinations of separation and transposition models is analyzed in a variety of situations. When only global irradiance is known, the accuracy of the tilted irradiance predictions degrades significantly, and is mainly conditioned by the local performance of the direct/diffuse separation method. For the south-facing vertical surface, inaccuracies in the ground reflection calculations becomes another key factor and significantly increase the prediction error. The Reindl transposition algorithm appears to perform best in this case. When using suboptimal input data for the prediction of plane-of-array irradiance on a moderately tilted plane (40°S) or a 2-axis tracking plane, the Hay, Reindl and Skartveit models are less penalized than others and tend to perform better. It is concluded that further research should be conducted to improve the overall process of predicting irradiance on tilted planes in realistic situations where no local high-quality irradiance or albedo measurements are available.},

The case where x and y need not be independent is also studied, and exact variance formulas are presented for several different “product estimates.” (The usefulness of exact formulas becomes apparent when the variances of these estimates are compared.)

Here, a methodology is developed to quantify not only these three activities simultaneously but also link them to the urban form. Two development scenarios (densification and expansion) are proposed for the village Hemberg in Switzerland for the years 2030 and 2050. The results show that, with reference to 2017, global warming increases the cooling demand of the buildings by 70\% in 2030 and by 115\% in 2050. The results also suggest that renovation is the key element for the future energy management and efficiency improvement in Hemberg because the building insulation has much greater effect on the energy demand than the urban form. Furthermore, the results suggest that a grid-integrated energy hub consisting of wind turbines and PV panels can supply 77\% of the annual energy demand in 2050. Also, urban form has great effects on building-integrated PV generation and, in general, on the integration of renewable technologies. The results contribute to efficient energy planning and policy-making for the future energy transition in Hemberg.},

This paper proposes a novel probabilistic baseline estimation framework that consists of a daily load profile pool construction stage, a deep learning-based clustering stage, an optimal cluster selection stage, and a quantile regression forests model construction stage. In particular, the concept of a daily load profile pool is introduced, and a deep-learning-based clustering approach is employed to handle a large number of daily patterns to further improve the baseline estimation performance. Case studies have been conducted on fine-grained smart meter data collected from a real dynamic time-of-use (dTOU) tariffs trial of the Low Carbon London (LCL) project. The superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated based on a series of evaluation metrics regarding both deterministic and probabilistic estimation results.},

	abstract = {Power system investment planning problems become intractable due to the vast variability that characterizes system operation and the increasing complexity of the optimization model to capture the characteristics of renewable energy sources. In this context, making optimal investment decisions by considering every operating period is unrealistic and inefficient. The conventional solution to address this computational issue is to select a limited number of representative operating periods by clustering the input demand-generation patterns while preserving the key statistical features of the original population. However, for an investment model that contains highly complex non-linear relationship between input data and optimal investment decisions, selecting representative periods by relying on only input data becomes inefficient. This paper proposes a novel investment cost-oriented representative day selection framework for large scale multi-spacial investment problems, which performs clustering directly based on the investment decisions for each generation technology at each location associated with each individual day. Additionally, dimensionality reduction is performed to ensure that the proposed method is feasible for large-scale power systems and high-resolution input data. The superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through a series of case studies with different levels of modeling complexity.},

	abstract = {Given the challenges related to climate change and dependency from fossil fuels, modification of the energy systems infrastructure to increase the share of renewable energy is a priority in urban energy planning. The high heating density in cities makes it more economically competitive to deploy district heating (DH), which is essential for large-scale integration of renewable energy sources. Combining georeferenced data with district heating design methods allows to improve the quality of the system design. However, increasing the spatial resolution can lead to intractable model sizes. This paper presents a methodology to spatially assess the integration of DH networks in urban energy systems. Given georeferenced data of buildings, resource availability and road networks, the methodology allows the identification of promising sites for DH deployment. First, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model divides the urban system into spatial clusters (of buildings). Graph theory and routing methods are then used to optimally design the DH configuration in each cluster considering the road network in the routing algorithm. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is formulated in order to economically evaluate the DH integration over the whole urban area. The proposed methodology is applied to an example case study, evaluating the use of geothermal energy (deep aquifer) for direct heat supply. The results of the optimization show the interest of deploying geothermal DH in some of the clusters. The profitability of DH integration is strongly affected by the spatial density of the heating demand.},

	abstract = {Due to climate change and the need to decrease the carbon footprint of urban areas, there is an increasing pressure to integrate renewable energy and other components in urban energy systems. Most of the models or available tools do not provide both an economic and environmental assessment of the energy systems and thus lead to the design of systems that are sub-optimal. A flexible and modular simulation tool, Eco-Sim, is thus developed in the current study to conduct a comprehensive techno-economic and environmental assessment of a distributed energy system considering different configuration scenarios. Subsequently, an intermodel comparison is conducted with the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) Pro as well as with a state-of-the-art industrial tool. Eco-Sim is then extended by including the heating demand, thermal conversion (by using heat pumps and solar thermal) methods and thermal storage. A parametric analysis is conducted by considering different capacities of solar photovoltaics (PV), solar thermal panels and energy storage technologies. The levelized cost of electricity, the autonomy level and the CO     2     emissions are used as the key performance indicators. Based on the analysis of a study case conducted in a neighbourhood in Geneva, Switzerland, the study reveals that, with the present market prices for batteries and seasonal changes in solar energy potential, the combination of solar PV with battery storage doesn\&rsquo;t bring a significant autonomy to the system and increases the CO     2     emissions of the system. However, the integration of thermal storage and solar thermal generation is shown to considerably increase the autonomy of the neighbourhood. Finally, multiple scenarios are also run in order to evaluate the sensitivity of economic parameters on the performance indicators of the system. Under the assumptions of the model, to foster investments in solar PV and battery installations, falling installation costs or stronger policies in favor of renewable energy seem necessary for the future.},

A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method was used, in which research questions were defined and translated into search strings. The search returned 38 papers for final evaluation, affirming that the use of these models to predict solar electricity generation is currently an ongoing academic research question.

	abstract = {This paper presents the general regression neural networks (GRNN) as a nonlinear regression method for the interpolation of monthly wind speeds in complex Alpine orography. GRNN is trained using data coming from Swiss meteorological networks to learn the statistical relationship between topographic features and wind speed. The terrain convexity, slope and exposure are considered by extracting features from the digital elevation model at different spatial scales using specialised convolution filters. A database of gridded monthly wind speeds is then constructed by applying GRNN in prediction mode during the period 1968–2008. This study demonstrates that using topographic features as inputs in GRNN significantly reduces cross-validation errors with respect to low-dimensional models integrating only geographical coordinates and terrain height for the interpolation of wind speed. The spatial predictability of wind speed is found to be lower in summer than in winter due to more complex and weaker wind-topography relationships. The relevance of these relationships is studied using an adaptive version of the GRNN algorithm which allows to select the useful terrain features by eliminating the noisy ones. This research provides a framework for extending the low-dimensional interpolation models to high-dimensional spaces by integrating additional features accounting for the topographic conditions at multiple spatial scales.

	abstract = {Research and development in photovoltaic (PV) systems has usually been concentrated in studies on radiation availability, efficient operating strategies, design and sizing of these systems. On the other hand, the influence of dust on the performance of PV systems has not been given much attention. The work described here contributes considerably to overcome this deficit. To validate that concept, we have developed an experimental set up involving 100 glass samples with different tilt (β) and azimuth angles (γ). The transmittance of the glass was evaluated at regular intervals over a period of about seven months and after every thunderstorm in the surrounding area. Although it is only a short term view, the preliminary results indicate that the reduction in glass normal transmittance depends strongly on the dust deposition density in conjunction with plate tilt angle, as well as on the orientation of the surface with respect to the dominant wind direction. With this consideration, one sees that as the dust deposition density goes from 15.84g/m2 (for glass sample installed at a tilt angle of 0°) to 4.48g/m2 (for glass sample installed at a tilt angle of 90° and oriented with 135° deviation from north), the corresponding transmittance diminishes by approximately 52.54–12.38\%, respectively. The evolutions of the output power variation with increasing cell pollution were also examined. It has been found that the slope of the best straight line passing through the data points of the solar cell installed at a 45° angle facing south suggests a decrease in the output power of about 17.4\% per month.},

	abstract = {What will the cities of tomorrow look like? This is a crucial question because in the four and a half billion years of its existence, the Earth has never been so threatened, as it is today. Since 2008 half of the world's population has lived in towns – more than 70\% in rich nations. Three quarters of CO2 emissions are produced in towns, 75\% of the world's energy is consumed in towns. The battle for our climate, for the continuation of our species and all other life, will be largely waged in cities. Will it be possible to create the ideal ecological town? The objective of this study is to compare actual and theoretical urban forms in order to explore the diverse effects of daylighting and solar potential on densely built-up sites. Indeed, the search for ideal solar orientations has been a persistent problem from the 19th century until the beginning of the 20th. Even today, for all our scientific knowledge and empirical experience of solar energy, making the correct choice has still not crossed the boundary from an enigmatic, tricky art into the field of an exact science. As a first step, six existing urban sites in Switzerland and Brazil, as well as two projects in the United Kingdom, a few generic models and a utopian city, were modelled and analyzed. The goal was not merely the construction of new, exemplary districts but also the transformation of existing towns. The findings have been used to assess the potential of façades and roofs located in urban areas for active and passive solar heating, photovoltaic electricity generation and daylighting. The results obtained from these different case studies revealed large variations of the potential for solar energy collection on the buildings' façades and roofs. Ideally, these investigations are expected to help architects and town planners understand how to optimise solar collection on buildings design. In addition, a study was made of the Contemporary City of Three Million Inhabitants created by Le Corbusier. According to the latter, the Contemporary City could increase the urban capacity and at the same time improve the urban environment and the efficiency of the city. Therefore the present study extracted the solar potential of this utopian city in order to assess Le Corbusier's propositions. Since 1922, Le Corbusier's studies have influenced architects and town-planners in their choice of orientations and urban forms: it was therefore crucial to discover if this reliance on Le Corbusier was justified. Solar irradiation and illuminance values obtained through numerical simulations form the core part of the method. The method adopted for the entire set of computer simulations consisted in modelling — via a computer-aided drawing piece of software, namely AutoCAD — the digital model of each building or group of buildings prior to exporting them to an urban performance analysis software (PPF/RADIANCE software package). Spatial distributions of solar irradiation and daylight fluxes over the overall building façades and roofs were calculated using ray-tracing simulation techniques to determine the appropriate placement of different solar technologies (passive and active solar, photovoltaic and daylighting). Performance indicators were used to assess the solar utilisation potential of the urban sites (e.g. statistics of sky view factors and daylight factors) in order to determine the optimal solar strategies for a given urban context. In addition, various works and sun-related recommendations that have appeared mainly since the end of the nineteenth century, together with the various scientific models and software tools pertaining to this topic, are presented in this study.

In this paper, we present a method to interpolate a DSM from point cloud data focusing on geometric modelling of rooftops. The method uses a combination of robustly fitted planes to local point clouds and inverse distance weighting interpolation. It was applied to roughly 3 million buildings, and compared to a reference DSM from a high density point cloud, which revealed a significant reduction of error compared to the existing DSM.},

The present study assesses photovoltaic (PV) potential of residential buildings. Two variables are modeled, the income of solar energy at the roof tops, and the population at the building level. The model is tested in Lisbon, Portugal, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based solar models and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data.

	abstract = {Timely and accurate classification and interpretation of high-resolution images are very important for urban planning and disaster rescue. However, as spatial resolution gets finer, it is increasingly difficultto recognize complex patterns in high-resolution remote sensing images. Deep learning offers an efficient strategy to fill the gap between complex image patterns and their semantic labels. However, due to the hierarchical abstract nature of deep learning methods, it is difficult to capture the precise outline of different objects at the pixel level. To further reduce this problem, we propose an object-based deep learning method to accurately classify the high-resolution imagery without intensive human involvement. In this study, high-resolution images were used to accurately classify three different urban scenes: Beijing (China), Pavia (Italy), and Vaihingen (Germany). The proposed method is built on a combination of a deep feature learning strategy and an object-based classification for the interpretation of high-resolution images. Specifically, high-level feature representations extracted through the convolutional neural networks framework have been systematically investigated over five different layer configurations. Furthermore, to improve the classification accuracy, an object-based classification method also has been integrated with the deep learning strategy for more efficient image classification. Experimental results indicate that with the combination of deep learning and object-based classification, it is possible to discriminate different building types in Beijing Scene, such as commercial buildings and residential buildings with classification accuracies above 90\%.},

This new version integrates the knowledge gained by various exploitations of the original method Heliosat and its varieties in a coherent and thorough way. It is based upon the same physical principles but the inputs to the method are calibrated radiances, instead of the digital counts output from the sensor. This change opens the possibilities of using known models of the physical processes in atmospheric optics, thus removing the need for empirically defined parameters and of pyranometric measurements to tune them. The ESRA models are used for modeling the clear-sky irradiation. The assessment of the ground albedo and the cloud albedo is based upon explicit formulations of the path radiance and the transmittance of the atmosphere. The method Heliosat-2 is applied to Meteosat images of Europe for the months of January 1995, April 1995 and July 1994. Pyranometric measurements performed by thirty-five meteorological stations are used to assess the performances that are close to those of Heliosat-1 found in the literature. Possible improvements are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present, demonstrate and validate a method for predicting city-wide electricity gains from photovoltaic panels based on detailed 3D urban massing models combined with Daysim-based hourly irradiation simulations, typical meteorological year climactic data and hourly calculated rooftop temperatures. The resulting data can be combined with online mapping technologies and search engines as well as a financial module that provides building owners interested in installing a photovoltaic system on their rooftop with meaningful data regarding spatial placement, system size, installation costs and financial payback. As a proof of concept, a photovoltaic potential map for the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, consisting of over 17,000 rooftops has been implemented as of September 2012. The new method constitutes the first linking of increasingly available GIS and LiDAR urban datasets with the validated building performance simulation engine Daysim, thus-far used primarily at the scale of individual buildings or small urban neighborhoods. A comparison of the new method with its predecessors reveals significant benefits as it produces hourly point irradiation data, supports better geometric accuracy, considers reflections from near by urban context and uses predicted rooftop temperatures to calculate hourly PV efficiency. A validation study of measured and simulated electricity yields from two rooftop PV installations in Cambridge shows that the new method is able to predict annual electricity gains within 3.6–5.3\% of measured production when calibrating for actual weather data and detailed PV panel geometry. This predicted annual error using the new method is shown to be less than the variance which can be expected from climactic variation between years. Furthermore, because the new method generates hourly data, it can be applied to peak load mitigation studies at the urban level. This study also compares predicted monthly energy yields using the new method to those of preceding methods for the two validated test installations and on an annual basis for 10 buildings selected randomly from the Cambridge dataset.},

	abstract = {The literature review shows a wide range of methodologies aiming at determining the photovoltaic (PV) potential. Very often, the methodology scale is too large (continents, countries or large regions) or too small (cities) or it is based on specific and non-commonly available software tools. This is why the proposed methodology to determine the PV roof potential in regions and/or islands can be useful. This methodology has been applied to the Canary Islands. Firstly, the available roof area for PV systems is determined, based on the total roof surface (using real data from the Spanish Cadastre) and utilization factors according to the municipality type. The methodology proposed to calculate the available roof surface is then compared to other well-known methods, including potential improvements using Geographical Information Systems. Secondly, the mean annual global solar radiation per municipality on inclined surfaces has been determined. To do so, a review of different methodologies has been assessed in a comprehensible manner, seeking for the ones that provide accuracy and simplicity. Thirdly, the yearly PV production per municipality has been calculated. For this, a step-by-step method to calculate the PV system efficiency, based on existing literature, has been detailed. Three different scenarios depending on the shared use of the available roof surface are defined and the corresponding PV production is calculated. A sensitivity analysis is also included, analyzing PV production in two cases: depending on back ventilation of the roof-mounted PV systems and on PV cell type (poly-crystalline to mono-crystalline). Finally, an economic assessment based on cost-resource curves is carried out. The spirit of the paper is to develop a methodology based on accuracy and, at the same, simplicity, understanding such as a method where all the calculations can be easily done using pen and paper, calculator and common office software programs.},

	abstract = {The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has a fast growing building sector driven by factors like burgeoning population, economic and infrastructure development and modernization. Buildings, owing to their energy intensive operation, are imposing significant energy, environmental and economic burdens for the country. To overcome these challenges and improve the sustainability levels in the building and energy sectors, it has been decided to develop 9500 MWs of renewable energy projects by 2023. Given the annual solar radiation level of over 2200 kWh/m2, solar energy is expected to play the predominant role in achieving this target. Traditionally, KSA’s emphasis has been to pursue large-scale energy projects. Globally, however, small scale and building related projects have significantly contributed to the rapid growth of solar energy. Application of solar technologies in buildings is one of the important areas that has been ignored in the country. This paper explores the potential for rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) in KSA’s residential sector. Taking into account appropriate PV design considerations and local building construction and cultural practices, it calculates the power generation potential for 13 major cities. It is found that a total of 51 TWh of electricity can be annually generated from these cities, accounting for 30\% of the total domestic demand.

The approach is data-driven, combining Geographic Information Systems analysis of an extensive dataset of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) measurements collected by the Department of Homeland Security with a statistical model trained on these same data. The model developed herein can predict the quantity of suitable roof area where LiDAR data is not available.

This paper presents new results characterizing the size, shape and suitability of US rooftops with respect to PV installations. Overall 28\% of small building roofs appear suitable in the continental United States for rooftop solar.

	abstract = {Solar energy deployment is gaining greater attention as a sustainable source of energy that could alleviate aspects of the current climate crisis. Knowledge of the characteristics and economics of the solar electricity sector is required to integrate it in the energy generation and utilization mix. Unlike energy generation from fossil fuels, renewable energy sources have relatively low geographic density and are spread unevenly over large areas. Therefore, especially in cities, where space has greater value and opportunity costs, finding suitable spaces for implementing solar systems are essential to promote the use of solar technologies. Using remote-sensing data, the intricate topography of cities can be modelled, and insolation incident at each location can be estimated. A multi-criteria approach based on geographic information systems (GIS) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is used in this research to estimate rooftop photovoltaic electricity potential of buildings in an urban environment, the city of Lethbridge. An economic assessment is conducted utilizing present market prices to determine economically attractive rooftop PV systems. The total rooftop photovoltaic (PV) electricity potential is evaluated and compared with the local electricity demand. Effective expansion of solar power systems in the city is achieved by determining the geographic distribution of the best locations for exploiting the systems. This study estimates that the rooftop PV electricity generation potential of the city of Lethbridge is approximately 301 ± 29 (SD) GWh annually (almost 38\% of its annual electricity consumption in 2016), and about 96\% of the recognized potential rooftop PV systems are economically feasible. The results can assist in making informed policy decisions about investment in deployment of renewable energy generation.},

The methodology considers input parameters, such as surface orientation, shadowing effect, elevation, and atmospheric conditions that influence solar intensity on the earth surface. The methodology has been implemented for some 212,000 buildings in Knox County, Tennessee, USA. Based on the results obtained, the methodology seems to be adequate for estimating solar radiation on multiple building rooftops.

Finally, conclusions are developed to provide a final methodology to extract the most useful information from the lowest resolution and least comprehensive data to provide solar electric assessments over large areas, which can be adapted anywhere in the world.},

	abstract = {A methodology for estimating the rooftop solar photovoltaic potential for a region has been described. The methodology has been applied and illustrated for the Indian city of Mumbai (18.98°N, 72.83°E). It uses high-granularity land use data available in the public domain and GIS-based image analysis of sample satellite images to estimate values of the Building Footprint Area (BFA) Ratio. Photovoltaic-Available Roof Area (PVA) Ratio has been estimated by simulations in PVSyst and has been compared with relevant values from the literature. Solar irradiance (DNI and DHI) and ambient temperature data have been taken from Climate Design Data 2009 ASHRAE Handbook. Liu Jordan transposition model has been used for estimating the plane-of-array insolation. Effect of tilt angle on the plane-of-array insolation received has been studied to make an optimum choice for the tilt angle. Micro-level simulations in PVSyst have been used to estimate effective sunshine hours for the region of interest. The installed capacity, annual and daily generation profiles and capacity factor have been estimated for PV panels with different rated solar cell efficiency and power–temperature coefficient values. The results show a potential of 2190MW for Mumbai city with median efficiency panels, at an annual average capacity factor of 14.8\%. Daily and monthly variation of the generation from the Rooftop PV Systems has been studied. Comparison with sample daily load profiles shows that large scale deployment of Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic Systems can provide 12.8–20\% of the average daily demand and 31–60\% of the morning peak demand for different months, even with median conversion efficiency panels. This method can be used to obtain the PV potential for any region.},

	abstract = {The solar photovoltaic (PV) system is known as one of the most outstanding new renewable energy systems for achieving the nearly zero energy building (nZEB). For the continuous deployment of the solar PV system in urban environments, it is crucial to estimate the rooftop solar PV potential. Urban areas, however, where high-rise buildings abound, are not always suitable for solar PV installation. Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate the available rooftop area considering the shadows from the surrounding buildings for reliable rooftop solar PV potential estimation. Therefore, this study proposed a method for estimating the rooftop solar PV potential by analyzing the available rooftop area through Hillshade analysis. Toward this end, the rooftop solar PV potential was estimated through the following hierarchical process: (i) calculation of the physical potential; (ii) calculation of the geographic potential; and (iii) calculation of the technical potential. For accurate estimation of the rooftop solar PV potential, the geographic potential (i.e., the available rooftop area) was explored in detail by analyzing the shadow based on the location of the sun through Hillshade analysis. By applying the proposed method to the Gangnam district in Seoul, South Korea, this study estimated the physical, geographic, and technical potentials on hourly, monthly, and annual bases. Overall, the physical, geographic, and technical potentials in the Gangnam district were found to be 9,287,982MWh, 4,964,118m2, and 1,130,371MWh, respectively. These rooftop solar PV potential results can be used in establishing solar policies by analyzing the different levels of the rooftop solar PV potential on hourly, monthly, and annual bases.},

Towards this end, this study aimed to propose a method for developing a rooftop solar PV rating system using cluster analysis based on the technical and economic suitability criteria. As a result, a rooftop solar PV rating system was developed for 21,681 buildings in the Gangnam district in Seoul, South Korea by dividing them into four grades according to their rooftop solar PV potential, return on investment, and payback period. The effectiveness of the proposed rating system was validated by comparing it with the rating systems developed using the classification method and suitability criteria from the previous studies.

As final results, tables summarizing the main methods characteristics and a selection of studies providing directly usable energy profiles are reported. Therefore, this study could be useful for stakeholders involved in energy simulations of buildings stocks and community energy planning in assessing the buildings energy demand, with different desired level of detail and available data. The research, broadly, demonstrates that the potential replicability of analysed methods is constrained to the datasets availability and, particularly, highlights the need of reliable hourly energy profiles definition for developing accurate energy scenarios.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the performance of 12 models to estimate hourly diffuse solar irradiation on inclined surfaces from those measured on horizontal surfaces. Total solar irradiation incident on a tilted surface consists of three components including: beam, diffuse and reflected from the ground. On a semi-hourly basis, the beam component can be calculated by the ratio of the incidence angle to the solar zenith angle. The reflected component has a small effect on calculations and may be calculated with an isotropic model. In contrast, models for estimating the diffuse component show major differences, which justify the validation study that this paper discusses. Twelve models were tested against recorded south- and west-facing slope irradiances at Karaj (35°55′N; 50°56′E), Iran. The following models were included: Badescu [Ba], Tian et al. [Ti], Perez et al. [P9], Reindl et al. [Re], Koronakis [Kr], Perez et al. [P8], Skartveit and Olseth [SO], Steven and Unsworth [SU], Hay [Ha], Klucher [Kl], Temps and Coulson [TC], and Liu and Jordan [LJ]. The relative root mean square error (RMSE), for the south-facing surface ranges from 10.16\% to 54.89\% for the SO and TC models, respectively. For the west-facing surface, RMSE ranges from 30.71\% for the P9 model to 63.53\% for the TC model. Statistical indices show that all models produce large errors for the west-facing surface. Statistical indices for the south-facing surface show reasonably good agreement with measured data.},

Validation of radiation models and algorithms implemented in building energy simulation codes is an essential endeavor for evaluating solar gain models. Seven solar radiation models implemented in four building energy simulation codes were investigated: (1) isotropic sky, (2) Klucher, (3) Hay–Davies, (4) Reindl, (5) Muneer, (6) 1987 Perez, and (7) 1990 Perez models. The building energy simulation codes included: EnergyPlus, DOE-2.1E, TRNSYS-TUD, and ESP-r. Solar radiation data from two 25 days periods in October and March/April, which included diverse atmospheric conditions and solar altitudes, measured on the EMPA campus in a suburban area in Duebendorf, Switzerland, were used for validation purposes. Two of the three measured components of solar irradiances – global horizontal, diffuse horizontal and direct-normal – were used as inputs for calculating global irradiance on a south-west façade. Numerous statistical parameters were employed to analyze hourly measured and predicted global vertical irradiances. Mean absolute differences for both periods were found to be: (1) 13.7\% and 14.9\% for the isotropic sky model, (2) 9.1\% for the Hay–Davies model, (3) 9.4\% for the Reindl model, (4) 7.6\% for the Muneer model, (5) 13.2\% for the Klucher model, (6) 9.0\%, 7.7\%, 6.6\%, and 7.1\% for the 1990 Perez models, and (7) 7.9\% for the 1987 Perez model. Detailed sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo and fitted effects for N-way factorial analyses were applied to assess how uncertainties in input parameters propagated through one of the building energy simulation codes and impacted the output parameter. The implications of deviations in computed solar irradiances on predicted thermal behavior and cooling load of buildings are discussed.},

Performance is assessed through comparison with three reference models: the isotropic, the Hay, and Klucher anisotropic models.

	abstract = {A techno-economic analysis is undertaken to assess hybrid PV/solar-thermal (PVT) systems for distributed electricity and hot-water provision in a typical house in London, UK. In earlier work (Herrando et al., 2014), a system model based on a PVT collector with water as the cooling medium (PVT/w) was used to estimate average year-long system performance. The results showed that for low solar irradiance levels and low ambient temperatures, such as those associated with the UK climate, a higher coverage of total household energy demands and higher CO2 emission savings can be achieved by the complete coverage of the solar collector with PV and a relatively low collector cooling ﬂow-rate. Such a PVT/w system demonstrated an annual electricity generation of 2.3 MW h, or a 51\% coverage of the household’s electrical demand (compared to an equivalent PV-only value of 49\%), plus a signiﬁcant annual water heating potential of to 1.0 MW h, or a 36\% coverage of the hot-water demand. In addition, this system allowed for a reduction in CO2 emissions amounting to 16.0 tonnes over a life-time of 20 years due to the reduction in electrical power drawn from the grid and gas taken from the mains for water heating, and a 14-tonne corresponding displacement of primary fossil-fuel consumption. Both the emissions and fossil-fuel consumption reductions are signiﬁcantly larger (by 36\% and 18\%, respectively) than those achieved by an equivalent PV-only system with the same peak rating/installed capacity. The present paper proceeds further, by considering the economic aspects of PVT technology, based on which invaluable policy-related conclusions can be drawn concerning the incentives that would need to be in place to accelerate the widespread uptake of such systems. It is found that, with an electricity-only Feed-In Tariff (FIT) support rate at 43.3 p/kW h over 20 years, the system cost estimates of optimised PVT/w systems have an 11.2-year discounted payback period (PV-only: 6.8 years). The role and impact of heat-based incentives is also studied. The implementation of a domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) at a rate of 8.5 p/kW h in quarterly payments leads to a payback reduction of about 1 year. If this incentive is given as a one-off voucher at the beginning of the system’s lifetime, the payback is reduced by about 2 years. With a RHI rate of 20 p/kW h (about half of the FIT rate) PVT technology would have approximately the same payback as PV. It is concluded that, if primary energy (currently dominated by fossil fuels) and CO2 emission minimisation are important goals of national energy policy, PVT systems offer a signiﬁcantly improved proposition over equivalent PV-only systems, but at an elevated cost. This is in need of careful reﬂection when developing relevant policy and considering technology incentivation. Currently, although heat outweighs electricity consumption by a factor of about 4 (by energy unit) in the UK domestic sector, the support landscape has strongly favoured electrical microgeneration, being inclined in favour of PV technology, which has been experiencing a well-documented exponential growth over recent decades.

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to assess the suitability of hybrid PVT systems for the provision of electricity and hot water (space heating is not considered) in the UK domestic sector, with particular focus on a typical terraced house in London. A model is developed to estimate the performance of such a system. The model allows various design parameters of the PVT unit to be varied, so that their inﬂuence in the overall system performance can be studied. Two key parameters, speciﬁcally the covering factor of the solar collector with PV and the collector ﬂow-rate, are considered. The emissions of the PVT system are compared with those incurred by a household that utilises a conventional energy provision arrangement. The results show that for the case of the UK (low solar irradiance and low ambient temperatures) a complete coverage of the solar collector with PV together with a low collector ﬂow-rate are beneﬁcial in allowing the system to achieve a high coverage of the total annual energy (heat and power) demand, while maximising the CO2 emissions savings. It is found that with a completely covered collector and a ﬂow-rate of 20 L/h, 51\% of the total electricity demand and 36\% of the total hot water demand over a year can be covered by a hybrid PVT system. The electricity demand coverage value is slightly higher than the PV-only system equivalent (49\%). In addition, our emissions assessment indicates that a PVT system can save up to 16.0 tonnes of CO2 over a lifetime of 20 years, which is signiﬁcantly (36\%) higher than the 11.8 tonnes of CO2 saved with a PV-only system. All investigated PVT conﬁgurations outperformed the PV-only system in terms of emissions. Therefore, it is concluded that hybrid PVT systems offer a notably improved proposition over PV-only systems.},

Addressing the elusive nature of urban planning and its need to cope with more technical sectors, the framework allows urban planners to generate and evaluate many alternative urban configurations, while focusing their attention on the most promising ones. First, addressing the need for integrated urban modeling approaches, a Mixed Integer Linear Programing (MILP) optimization model representing both urban and energy system components was developed. Second, an interface based on parallel coordinates and georeferenced maps is proposed to effectively communicate the optimization results to decision makers, revealing tradeoffs and synergies between competing objectives. Interaction with the parallel coordinates charts further allows planners to steer consecutive optimization runs based on their preferences and experience. The framework is applied to an urban development project in Switzerland to demonstrate its usability and relevance.},

	abstract = {Rooftop photovoltaic systems integrated with lithium-ion battery storage are a promising route for the decarbonisation of the UK’s power sector. From a consumer perspective, the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of lower utility costs and the potential of a ﬁnancial return through providing grid services is a strong incentive to invest in PV-battery systems. Although battery storage is generally considered an eﬀective means for reducing the energy mismatch between photovoltaic supply and building demand, it remains unclear when and under which conditions battery storage can be proﬁtably operated within residential photovoltaic systems. This fact is particularly pertinent when battery degradation is considered within the decision framework. In this work, a commercially available coupled photovoltaic lithium-ion battery system is installed within a mid-sized UK family home. Photovoltaic energy generation and household electricity demand is recorded for more than one year. A comprehensive battery degradation model based on long-term ageing data collected from more than ﬁfty long-term degradation experiments on commercial Lithium-ion batteries is developed. The comprehensive model accounts for all established modes of degradation including calendar ageing, capacity throughput, ambient temperature, state of charge, depth of discharge and current rate. The model is validated using cycling data and exhibited an average maximum transient error of 7.4\% in capacity loss estimates and 7.3\% in resistance rise estimates for over a year of cycling. The battery ageing model is used to estimate the cost of battery degradation associated with cycling the battery according to the power proﬁle logged from the residential property. A detailed cost-beneﬁt analysis using the data collected from the property and the battery degradation model shows that, in terms of utility savings and export revenue, the integration of a battery yields no added beneﬁt. This result was, in-part, attributed to the relatively basic control strategy and eﬃciency of the system. Furthermore, when the cost of battery degradation is included, the homeowner is subject to a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial loss.},

	abstract = {The paper presents the core methodology for assessing solar radiation and energy production on building rooftops and vertical facades (still rarely considered) of the inner-city. This integrated tool is based on the use of LiDAR, 2D and 3D cadastral data. Together with solar radiation and astronomical models it calculates the global irradiance for a set of points located on roofs, ground and facades. Although the tool takes simultaneously roofs, ground and facades, different methods of shadow casting are applied. Shadow casting on rooftops is based on image processing techniques. On the other hand, the assessment on facade involves first to create and interpolate points along the facades and then to implement a point-by-point shadow casting routine. The paper is structured in five parts: (i) state of the art on the use of 3D GIS and automated processes in assessing solar radiation in the built environment, (ii) overview on the methodological framework used in the paper, (iii) detailed presentation of the method proposed for solar modelling and shadow casting, in particular by introducing an innovative approach for modelling the Sky View Factor (SVF), (iv) demonstration of the solar model introduced in this paper through applications in Geneva’s building roofs (solar cadaster) and facades, (v) validation of the solar model in some Geneva’s spots, focusing especially on two distinct comparisons: solar model versus fisheye catchments on partially inclined surfaces (roof component); solar model versus photovoltaic simulation tool PVSyst on vertical surfaces (facades). Concerning the roof component, validation results emphasize global sensitivity related to the density of light sources on the sky vault to model the SVF. The low dense sky model with 145 light sources gives satisfying results, especially when processing solar cadasters in large urban areas, thus allowing to save computation time. In the case of building facades, introducing weighting factor in SVF calculation leads to outputs close to those obtained by PVSyst. Such good validation results make the proposed model a reliable tool to: (i) automatically process solar cadaster on building rooftops and facades at large urban scales, (ii) support solar energy planning and energy transition policies.},

	abstract = {Generating solar photovoltaic (PV) power in urban areas is a promising 
approach to cover our energy demand and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, the high variability of solar energy in both time and space
must be taken into account when assessing the suitability of solar PV
panels in urban areas. To model the spatio-temporal variation of solar
irradiance (i.e. solar power at the earth's surface per unit area),
several statistical and machine learning approaches have been applied.
The existing models mostly focus on either spatial or temporal
estimation and forecasting, and hence are not optimal for very large
spatio-temporal data. We propose a high-performance implementation of an
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) ensemble algorithm to estimate the solar
irradiance (i) at an hourly temporal resolution (ii) on a national scale
(iii) from a large historical data set. ELM ensembles are well-suited
for large-scale estimation, as they exhibit the following
characteristics (Huang et al, 2014): (i) they are fast and scalable
algorithms, (ii) the number of parameters to tune is low, (iii) they
allow an indication of confidence intervals. An ensemble combines a set
of Extreme Learning Machines (Huang et al, 2006), which are Single-Layer
Neural Networks (SLNs) with randomly assigned input weights that can be
trained extremely quickly. The input to each ELM is a subsampled version
of the training data based on a bootstrapping approach. The outputs of
the individual ELMs are aggregated and give the estimated value as well
as the probability distribution from which the confidence intervals are
constructed. To reduce the computational complexity of training many
ELMs on a large multi-dimensional dataset, the Bag of Little Bootstraps
approach can be used (Kleiner et al., 2012). In the present study, we
use an Extreme Learning Machine ensemble algorithm to estimate the
monthly-mean-hourly global and direct solar irradiance at the national
scale of Switzerland. The model is trained on hourly satellite-based
irradiance data of Switzerland ( 10,000 locations) from 2004 to 2015. A
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is used to define the coordinates of the
training data points. The modelling is performed in three stages: (i)
data pre-processing to identify missing values and outliers, (ii)
ensemble training using a high-performance ELM implementation, (iii)
estimation of hourly solar irradiance for a dense grid (200m ×
200m) over Switzerland. This approach could be easily expanded to
include auxiliary environmental parameters such as temperature,
precipitation, or sky clearness index. It may further be applied to
other environmental problems for computationally efficient large-scale
spatio-temporal estimation, forecasting and quantification of
uncertainties. Huang, G., Huang, G.-B., Song, S. \& You, K. (2014)

Accurate spatial and temporal modelling of solar irradiance is a key factor in the evaluation of PV technology potential for harvesting solar energy. We present here a data-driven approach based on an ensemble of Extreme Learning Machines using geographic and topographic features in input to predict the global horizontal irradiance in Switzerland from coarse-resolution satellite measurements. This provides a precise mapping of hourly global solar irradiance for each (250 × 250) m2 pixel of a grid covering the entire country. The uncertainty on predicted values is quantified through a variance-based analysis, able to distinguish between model and data uncertainty. The former amounts to 1\%, whereas the latter is close to 15\% of the predicted values. The presented methodology is scalable and applicable to any large environmental dataset. Our modelling of solar irradiance at hourly temporal resolution and of its uncertainty will allow for an estimate of hourly PV potential in Switzerland to facilitate a more efficient integration of solar photovoltaics into the built environment.},

	abstract = {An estimate of solar irradiation potential over large regions requires the knowledge of the long-term spatiotemporal distribution of the solar radiation as well as the identiﬁcation of the suitable surfaces where the photovoltaic (PV) installations can be built. These main components can be modelled in diﬀerent ways and are thus aﬀected by diﬀerent sources of uncertainty. Thus, when estimating the exploitable potential over large regions, it is important to measure the accuracy of the entire process. In this work, we provide a generic method to estimate the solar irradiation potential of rooftops over large regions and an estimate of the corresponding uncertainties when calculating the long-term electricity generation of PV plants. This method uses satellite based solar radiation data covering a period of 22 years, with a temporal resolution of 30 min and a spatial resolution of 3.8–5.6 km. Suitable surfaces on rooftops are identiﬁed using Digital Surface Models combined with building footprints. This allows to determine the geometry of rooftops, such as slope, and orientation with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m. Finally, we calculated the electricity generation based on models which take into account all characteristics of PV system components. In order to estimate the accuracy of the model for electricity production, we compared the monthly generation of 500 PV plants in Switzerland consisting of diﬀerent PV technologies (mono-crystalline, poly-crystalline and thin ﬁlm) with the estimates. The validation results show a correlation coeﬃcient (R2) of 0.9 and a median monthly relative error between 0.28\% (August) and 28.08\% (December). The monthly estimates are more accurate during summer time, while spatially and technology-wise no signiﬁcant diﬀerences are found.},

This contribution presents a new method to provide local decision makers with tools to assess the remaining PV potential within their respective communities. It allows highly detailed analyses without having to rely on 3D city models, which are often not available. This is achieved by a combination of publicly available geographical building data and aerial images that are analyzed using image recognition and machine learning approaches. The method also employs sophisticated algorithms for irradiance simulation and power generation that exhibit a higher accuracy than most existing PV potential studies. The method is demonstrated with an application to the city of Freiburg, for which a technical PV electricity generation potential of about 524GWh/a is identified. A validation with a 3D city model shows that the correct roof azimuth can be determined with an accuracy of about 70\% and existing solar installations can be detected with an accuracy of about 90\%. This demonstrates that the method can be employed for spatially and temporally detailed PV potential assessments in arbitrary urban areas when only public geographical building data is available instead of exact 3D city model data. Future work will focus on methodological improvements as well as on the integration of the method within an urban energy system modeling framework.},

In a first step, climate, geological, hydrogeological and thermophysical data, useful for the elaboration of specific thematic maps, are collected and organized on a provincial scale. Follows a second step in which, by using of GIS spatial analysis tools, the physical parameters that mostly influence both the thermal demand for building air conditioning and the thermal performance of the underground, in terms of heat exchange and storage, are spatially represented. The shallow underground is investigated to the depth of 100m, considering the heat transfer by conduction and by convection (considering the groundwater flow). Finally, to obtain a representation of how the geo-exchange potential for vertical closed-loop systems differs within the study area, the considered properties are combined identifying specific heat extraction rates (W/m), according to the German VDI guideline 4640. In the Province of Trento (Italy), a detailed demonstration study focuses on the Adige Valley, thanks to the availability of a high number of geognostic drillings (358) and hydrogeological measurement points (288), distributed uniformly across the whole area.},

In this study, techno-economic maps for shallow geothermal potential of Cantone Ticino are produced, considering closed-loop systems. The work starts with the identification of the main parameters affecting the techno-economic potential such as GST and thermal conductivity. Maps for different indicators of techno-economic feasibility are created and compared against real data/measurements. An empirical method is tailored to derive a map of the techno-economic geothermal potential, expressed as meters required to provide 1 kW of installed power. The produced map shows an overall discrepancy from real installed length data of approximately \&plusmn;23\%. Moreover, compared with current regulation, the produced maps show an unoptimized management of the shallow geothermal resource, since high potential zones are commonly located where the installation of BHE is not permitted and often closed-loop systems are installed where the estimated potential is lower, mainly in alluvial fans. In light of these considerations, the authorization process in Cantone Ticino for BHE should be revised taking into account the real techno-economic potential.},

Flat roofs are highly suitable for the placement of PV systems to produce renewable energy, but the assessment of its exact energy potential is not straightforward. Important configurations parameters of PV systems are the inclination and row distance, both leading to mutual shading. This study examined the technical and economic consequences of mutual shading of PV systems. In the first part, a comparison is performed between an unshaded module and a shaded module with different row distances and inclinations; in the second part, the energy output as well as payback times of a PV system on a flat roof were simulated. A significant decrease in energy production was seen due to mutual shading, while the configuration to achieve the maximum energy output was at an inclination of 0° and a row distance of 0 metres. Payback calculations showed that, when electricity prices rise in the future, more options concerning inclination and row distance became feasible.},

The best uncertainty achieved in most of these articles is greater than ±0.01° in calculating the solar zenith and azimuth angles. For some, the algorithm is valid for a limited number of years varying from 15 years to a hundred years. This report is a step by step procedure for implementing an algorithm to calculate the solar zenith and azimuth angles in the period from the year À2000 to 6000, with uncertainties of ±0.0003°. The algorithm is described in a book written by Jean Meeus in 1998. This report is written in a step by step format to simplify the complicated steps described in the book, with a focus on the sun instead of the planets and stars in general. It also introduces some changes to accommodate for solar radiation applications. The changes include changing the direction of measuring azimuth angles to be measured from north and eastward instead of being measured from south and eastward, and the direction of measuring the observer’s geographical longitude to be measured as positive eastward from Greenwich meridian instead of negative. This report also includes the calculation of incidence angle for a surface that is tilted to any horizontal and vertical angle, as described by Iqbals in 1983.},

	abstract = {Small grid-connected photovoltaic systems up to 5kWp are often not monitored because advanced surveillance systems are not economical. Hence, some system failures which lead to partial energy losses stay unnoticed for a long time. Even a failure that results in a larger energy deficit can be difficult to detect by PV laymen due to the fluctuating energy yields. Within the EU project PVSAT-2, a fully automated performance check has been developed to assure maximum energy yields and to optimize system maintenance for small grid-connected PV systems. The aim is the early detection of system malfunctions and changing operating conditions to prevent energy and subsequent financial losses for the operator. The developed procedure is based on satellite-derived solar irradiance information that replaces on-site measurements. In conjunction with a simulation model the expected energy yield of a PV system is calculated. In case of the occurrence of a defined difference between the simulated and actual energy yield, an automated failure detection routine searches for the most probable failure sources and notifies the operator. This paper describes the individual components of the developed procedure—the satellite-derived irradiance, the used PV simulation model, and the principles of the automated failure detection routine. Moreover, it presents results of an 8-months test phase with 100PV systems in three European countries.},

The model represents the output power of the module as a function of module temperature and in-plane irradiance, with a number of coefficients to be determined by fitting to measured performance data from indoor or outdoor measurements. The model has been validated using data from 3 different modules characterized through extensive measurements in outdoor conditions over several seasons. The model was then applied to indoor measurement data for 18 different PV modules to investigate the variability in modeled output from different module types. It was found that for a Central European climate the modeled output of the 18 modules varies with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.22\%, but that the between-module variation is higher at low irradiance (SD of 3.8\%). The variability between modules of different types is thus smaller than the uncertainty normally found in the total solar irradiation per year for a given site. We conclude that the model can therefore be used for generalized estimates of PV performance with only a relatively small impact on the overall uncertainty of such estimates resulting from different module types.},

The monthly average diffuse component of radiation can be predicted from the hemispherical radiation by the use of an appropriate empirical correlation relating the monthly average diffuse fraction to monthly average clearness index. Hourly average radiation values are estimated from daily values using a statistical model. The condition that there should be no net battery energy gain during the average day enables the correct setting of the battery energy level at the beginning of the day.

	abstract = {Renewable energies arise as part of both economic development plans and mitigation strategies aimed at abating climate change. Contrariwise, most renewable energies are potentially vulnerable to climate change, which could affect in particular solar and wind power. Proper evaluations of this two-way climate–renewable energy relationship require detailed information of the geographical location of the renewable energy fleets. However, this information is usually provided as total amounts installed per administrative region, especially with respect to future planned installations. To help overcome this limiting issue, the objective of this contribution was to develop the so-called CLIMIX model: a tool that performs a realistic spatial allocation of given amounts of both photovoltaic (PV) and wind power installed capacities and evaluates the energy generated under varying climate conditions. This is done over a regular grid so that the created scenarios can be directly used in conjunction with outputs of climate models. First, we used the 0.44° resolution grid defined for the EURO-CORDEX project and applied the CLIMIX model to spatially allocate total amounts of both unreported 2012 and future 2020 PV and wind power installations in Europe at the country level. Second, we performed a validation exercise using the various options for estimating PV and wind power production under the created scenarios that are included in the model. The results revealed an acceptable agreement between the estimated and the recorded power production values in every European country. Lastly, we estimated increases in power production derived from the future deployment of new renewable units, often obtaining non-direct relationships. This latter further emphasizes the need of accurate spatially-resolved PV and wind power scenarios in order to perform reliable estimations of power production.},

Its time-varying power output is difﬁcult to model credibly because it depends on complex and variable weather systems, leading to difﬁculty in understanding its potential and limitations. We demonstrate how the MERRA and MERRA-2 global meteorological reanalyses as well as the Meteosat-based CM-SAF SARAH satellite dataset can be used to produce hourly PV simulations across Europe. To validate these simulations, we gather metered time series from more than 1000 PV systems as well as national aggregate output reported by transmission network operators. We ﬁnd slightly better accuracy from satellite data, but greater stability from reanalysis data. We correct for systematic bias by matching our simulations to the mean bias in modeling individual sites, then examine the long-term patterns, variability and correlation with power demand across Europe, using thirty years of simulated outputs. The results quantify how the increasing deployment of PV substantially changes net power demand and affects system adequacy and ramping requirements, with heterogeneous impacts across different European countries.

	abstract = {Today, 75\% of global energy consumption occurs in cities. On the topic of climate change, adapting urban settlements to face this growing demand is a priority issue, especially for fast-growing cities in developing countries such as Brazil. Planning the urban morphology of the built environment is a key issue in shifting to a climate adapted urban environment. This paper addresses an important threefold energy challenge of tropical cities: the major potential of harnessing solar energy as renewable resource for local electricity production and the energy-saving paradox of reducing the undesirable solar heat gains in buildings while providing satisfactory levels of daylight. It aims at measuring the effect size of urban form factors regarding these energy goals. This study applies the Design Of Experiments (DOE) approach. A DOE analysis is a statistical technique that provides a set measure of how design parameters are correlated and the effective contribution of each one to a given response of interest. This study proposes a fractional factorial DOE method coupled to a Simplified Radiosity Algorithm (SRA) aiming to evaluate the irradiation availability on building envelopes while taking a large representative sample of contrasted urban block geometries into account. The buildings’ envelope solar irradiation availability assesses a set of energy-related morphological parameters. Results indicate a significant impact of the aspect ratio, the distance between buildings and the surface equivalent albedo. Establishing high values of street aspect ratio may cut solar irradiation on roofs by 130kWh/m2year, while increasing the plot ratio may only yield 26kWh/m2year. The results also point out important first order interaction effects between certain variables.},

Data includes local energy resource potentials, existing heat and electricity energy demands by sector, and the developed environment classification for approximately 2300 municipalities. Select archetypes are analyzed using a cost optimization model to determine the optimal utilization of local resources and decentralized generation technologies until 2050 under different national energy policy scenarios. Local energy resources provide approximately 40\% of municipal heat generation (largely using solar, waste, and wood potentials) and 20\% of municipal electricity generation (largely using photovoltaics) by 2050, on average across the modeled archetypes. Urban archetypes demonstrate high rooftop solar and waste potentials and usage rates, while smaller rural and suburban archetypes exhibit relatively high manure, wood and small hydro potentials and usage. Efficiency measures (e.g., renovations) and high CO2 prices are vital to achieving long-term local energy demand and emissions reductions.},

	abstract = {The energy demand in urban areas has increased dramatically over the last few decades because of the intensive urbanization that has taken place. Because of this, the European Union has introduced directives pertaining to the energy performance of buildings and has identified demand side management as a significant tool for the optimization of the energy demand. Demand side management, together with thermal energy storage and renewable energy technologies, have mainly been studied so far at a building scale. In order to study and define potential demand side management strategies at an urban scale, an integrated urban scale assessment needs to be conducted. DiDeProM, a model that can be used to generate detailed thermal energy demand profiles, at an urban district scale, has been developed in the current study. It is a bottom-up engineering model, based on samples of the representative building technique. A parametric analysis of the important variables of building energy performance at an urban scale has then been carried out. This has generated a database of normalized thermal energy demand profiles with an hourly time resolution. The final step of the process includes the generation of a detailed overall thermal energy demand profile at an urban district scale. DiDeProM was applied to a block of buildings in Turin (Italy) as a case study. After the calibration of the simulation model on real monitored data, a parametric analysis on 300 scenarios for a reference building was conducted, generating a database of seasonal thermal heating energy demand profiles with hourly time steps. An average hourly heating profile was generated from this database according to a specific aggregation approach. The DiDeProM application indicated that the model works properly at the scale of a typical small block of buildings, and it is able to generate a total thermal energy demand profile, with detailed time resolution, at an urban district scale. These profiles will be used to create demand side management strategies that will integrate thermal energy storage and renewable energy technologies at a district scale.},

	abstract = {Using data from two measurement networks, we analyse the following aspects of wind speeds over Switzerland to assess the possibility of high wind power penetration: spatial correlation, persistent low wind power conditions and the diurnal and seasonal wind speed patterns. We show that correlation amongst speeds as a function of distance is significantly lower compared to values found in literature. This can be attributed to the complex terrain of the Alps, which has a profound influence on meteorological parameters. Secondly, using extreme value analysis we calculate return levels for low wind power periods. Large differences are found, with return levels ranging from 29 to 1017h of no power production for a return period of 10years. No clear spatial pattern was found that can account for these values. However, the length of no-production periods decreases with increasing elevation. Next, we investigate diurnal and seasonal wind speed patterns and show how the different patterns and their intra-annual variation can be explained by local topography. We also find that with increasing elevation mean wind speeds and power production increase, even when accounting for lower air density. Wind speeds are on average higher in winter, and at elevation the relative increase in winter compared to summer is higher. Notable exceptions are explained from topography and carry implications for wind power development. In view of Switzerland’s electricity shortage in winter, these findings make a strong claim for wind power development, especially at higher elevations.},

Bringing urban solar energy to a system level gives a more realistic estimate of the useable solar potential in cities. The model is intended for a ﬁrst estimate of the potential and it needs a limited amount of input data, typical in developing countries. The ﬁrst sub-model comprises a step-by-step approach starting with a global temporal solar radiation pattern to which spatial urban and building topologies are linked to assess solar losses. Next the available solar energy potential is estimated according to type of housing, solar energy technology, and demand patterns. The second sub-model on energy systems uses the output from the solar resource model by putting the building speciﬁc solar energy data into the energy system level, considering the energy infrastructure such as the electric grid and ﬁnally yielding an estimate of the useable solar potential in a city. We apply the model to the city of Concepción in Chile as a test case to show the versatility of it.},

	abstract = {Wind resource assessment is fundamental when selecting a site for wind energy projects. Wind is influenced by several environmental factors and understanding its spatial variability is key in determining the economic viability of a site. Numerical wind flow models, which solve physical equations that govern air flows, are the industry standard for wind resource assessment. These methods have been proven over the years to be able to estimate the wind resource with a relatively high accuracy. However, measuring stations, which provide the starting data for every wind estimation, are often located at some distance from each other, in some cases tens of kilometres or more. This adds an unavoidable amount of uncertainty to the estimations, which can be difficult and time consuming to calculate with numerical wind flow models. For this reason, even though there are ways of computing the overall error of the estimations, methods based on physics fail to provide planners with detailed spatial representations of the uncertainty pattern. In this paper we introduce a statistical method for estimating the wind resource, based on statistical learning. In particular, we present an approach based on ensembles of regression trees, to estimate the wind speed and direction distributions continuously over the United Kingdom (UK), and provide planners with a detailed account of the spatial pattern of the wind map uncertainty.},

In this study, a bottom-up model is proposed to estimate residential energy demand using datasets that are commonly available in the United States. The model applies novel machine learning methods to match records in the Residential Energy Consumption Survey with Public Use Microdata samples. This matching and machine learning produce a synthetic household energy distribution at a neighborhood scale.

The scope of this paper is to determine the solar photovoltaic potential at an urban and regional scale using CityGML geometry descriptions of every building. An innovative urban simulation platform is used to calculate the PV potential of the Ludwigsburg County in south-west Germany, in which every building was simulated by using 3D city models. Both technical and economic potential (considering roof area and insolation thresholds) are investigated, as well as two different PV efficiency scenarios. In this way, it was possible to determine the fraction of the electricity demand that can be covered in each municipality and the whole region, deciding the best strategy, the profitability of the investments and determining optimal locations. Additionally, another important contribution is a literature review regarding the different methods of PV potential estimation and the available roof area reduction coefficients. An economic analysis and emission assessment has also been developed. The results of the study show that it is possible to achieve high annual rates of covered electricity demand in several municipalities for some of the considered scenarios, reaching even more than 100\% in some cases. The use of all available roof space (technical potential) could cover 77\% of the region’s electricity consumption and 56\% as an economic potential with only high irradiance roofs considered. The proposed methodological approach should contribute valuably in helping policy-making processes and communicating the advantages of distributed generation and PV systems in buildings to regulators, researchers and the general public.},

This paper presents a novel technique for estimating commercial building energy consumption from a small number of building features by training machine learning models on national data from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). Our results show that gradient boosting regression models perform the best at predicting commercial building energy consumption, and can make predictions that are on average within a factor of 2 from the true energy consumption values (with an r2 score of 0.82). We validate our models using the New York City Local Law 84 energy consumption dataset, then apply them to the city of Atlanta to create aggregate energy consumption estimates. In general, the models developed only depend on five commonly accessible building and climate features, and can therefore be applied to diverse metropolitan areas in the United States and to other countries through replication of our methodology.},

Results indicate that the alteration of solar PV supply by the end of this century compared with the estimations made under current climate conditions should be in the range (−14\%;+2\%), with the largest decreases in Northern countries. Temporal stability of power generation does not appear as strongly affected in future climate scenarios either, even showing a slight positive trend in Southern countries.

	abstract = {Traditionally, for the planning and assessment of solar energy systems, the amount of solar radiation (sunlight) incident on the Earth’s surface is assumed to be constant over the years. However, with changing climate and air pollution levels, solar resources may no longer be stable over time and undergo substantial decadal changes. Observational records covering the past decades confirm long-term changes in this quantity. Here we examine how the latest generation of climate models used for the 5th IPCC report projects potential changes in surface solar radiation over the coming decades, and how this may affect, in combination with the expected greenhouse warming, solar power output from photovoltaic (PV) systems. For this purpose, projections up to the mid 21st century from 39 state of the art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are analysed globally and for selected key regions with major solar power production capacity. The large model ensemble allows to assess the degree of consistency of their projections. Models are largely consistent in the sign of the projected changes in solar radiation under cloud-free conditions as well as surface temperatures over most of the globe, while still reasonably consistent over a considerable part of the globe in the sign of changes in cloudiness and associated changes in solar radiation. A first order estimate of the impact of solar radiation and temperature changes on energy yields of PV systems under the RPC8.5 scenario indicates statistically significant decreases in PV outputs in large parts of the world, but notable exceptions with positive trends in large parts of Europe, South-East of North America and the South-East of China. Projected changes between 2006 and 2049 under the RCP8.5 scenario overall are on the order of 1\%/decade for horizontal planes, but may be larger for tilted or tracked planes as well as on shorter (decadal) timescales.},

The SVM correctly identifies six types of roof shapes in 66\% of cases, that is, flat \& shed, gable, hip, gambrel \& mansard, cross/corner gable \& hip, and complex roofs. We classify the roofs based on their useful area for PV installations and potential for receiving solar energy. For most roof shapes, the ratio between useful roof area and building footprint area is close to one, suggesting that footprint is a good measure of useful PV roof area. The main exception is the gable where this ratio is 1.18. The flat and shed roofs have the second highest useful roof area for PV (complex roof being the highest) and the highest PV potential (in GWh). By contrast, hip roof has the lowest PV potential. Solar roof-shape classification provides basic information for designing new buildings, retrofitting interventions on the building roofs, and efficient solar integration on the roofs of buildings.},

A 3D model for solar energy potential on building envelope based on urban LiDAR data was developed in this study. The developed algorithm can be used to model solar irradiation with high spatio-temporal resolution for roofs, facades, and ground surfaces simultaneously based on urban LiDAR data taking into account the vegetation. Global solar irradiation was then obtained for each point on the buildings and ground surfaces with a spatial resolution of 1m2 and a time resolution of 1 hour. The algorithm has been implemented in Matlab and the results were generated for two different test areas in the city of Geneva in Switzerland. The results show that even in a dense urban area, the upper parts of south-east to south-west oriented facades receive 600 to 1000 kWh/m2/year of solar input which is suitable for active solar installations. The results also show that south oriented facades can get higher solar input during winter months than the low inclined roof surfaces. This shows that facades have a signiﬁcant impact on the solar potential of buildings in an urban area, particularly for a sustainable energy planning application.},

Conceptually the model is based on equations published in the European Solar Radiation Atlas (ESRA). The r.sun model was applied to estimate the solar potential for photovoltaic systems in Central and Eastern Europe. The overcast radiation was computed from clear-sky values and a clear-sky index. The raster map of the clear-sky index was computed using a multivariate interpolation method to account for terrain effects, with interpolation parameters optimized using a cross-validation technique. The incorporation of terrain data improved the radiation estimates in terms of the model's predictive error and the spatial pattern of the model outputs. Comparing the results of r.sun with the ESRA database demonstrates that integration of the solar radiation model and the spatial interpolation tools in a GIS can be especially helpful for data at higher resolutions and in regions with a lack of ground measurements.},

Eight accuracy indicators for hourly data in the period 1995–2015 are calculated. Widely used indicators such as the Pearson's correlation coefficient in some cases reach values above 0.82 for wind speeds and above 0.92 for global horizontal irradiance. The mean bias error is consistently better than ± 9.3 W/m2 for the full set of irradiance data, ±25.1 W/m2 for only day-time irradiance data and is, with a few exceptions, lower than ± 1 m/s for the wind speed data.},

However, the availability of observed solar radiation measurements has proven to be spatially and temporally inadequate for many applications. In this paper we propose to merge the global solar radiation measurements from the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium solar measurements network with the operationally derived surface incoming global short-wave radiation products from Meteosat Second Generation satellites imageries to improve the spatio-temporal resolution of the surface global solar radiation data over Belgium. We evaluate several merging methods with various degrees of complexity (from mean field bias correction to geostatistical merging techniques) together with interpolated ground measurements and satellite-derived values only. The performance of the different methods is assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation.},

	abstract = {One of the major challenges today is assessing the suitability of PV (photovoltaic) systems' installations on buildings' roofs regarding the received solar irradiance. The availability of aerial laser-scanning, namely LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), means that assessment can be performed automatically over large-scale urban areas in high accuracy by considering surfaces' topographies, long-term direct and diffuse irradiance measurements, and influences of shadowing. The solar potential metric was introduced for this purpose, however it fails to provide any insights into the production of electrical energy by a specific PV system. Hence, the PV potential metric can be used that integrates received instantaneous irradiance which is then multiplied by the PV system's efficiency characteristics. Many existing PV potential metrics over LiDAR data consider the PV modules' efficiencies to be constant, when in reality they are nonlinear. This paper presents a novel PV potential estimation over LiDAR data, where the PV modules' and solar inverter's nonlinear efficiency characteristics are approximated by modelled functions. The estimated electrical energy production from buildings' roofs within an urban area was extensively analysed by comparing the constant and nonlinear efficiency characteristics of different PV module types and solar inverters. The obtained results were confirmed through measurements performed on an existing PV system.},

This study characterizes residential rooftop shading in Sacramento, San Jose, Los Angeles and San Diego, CA. Our analysis can be used to better estimate power production and/or thermal collection by rooftop solar-energy equipment. It can also be considered when designing programs to plant shade trees. High-resolution orthophotos and LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) measurements of surface height were used to create a digital elevation model of all trees and buildings in a well-treed 2.5–4km2 residential neighborhood. On-hour shading of roofing planes (the flat elements of roofs) was computed geometrically from the digital elevation model. Values in future years were determined by repeating these calculations after simulating tree growth. Parcel boundaries were used to determine the extent to which roofing planes were shaded by trees and buildings in neighboring parcels. For the subset of S+SW+W-facing planes on which solar equipment is commonly installed for maximum solar access, absolute light loss in spring, summer and fall peaked about 2 to 4h after sunrise and about 2 to 4h before sunset. The fraction of annual insolation lost to shading increased from 0.07–0.08 in the year of surface-height measurement to 0.11–0.14 after 30 years of tree growth. Only about 10\% of this loss resulted from shading by trees and buildings in neighboring parcels.},

	abstract = {Energy system models on country level usually contain multiple energy carriers at different granularity. While data is comparably rich in terms of temporal and spatial resolution for the electricity part, much less is known for heat. Especially the true demand for heat as a function of usage and time is difﬁcult to obtain. In many cases, energy consumption data (fuel oil, natural gas, district heating etc.) is taken as approximation for the ﬁnal energy end-use of heat. Different heat distribution technologies bring their own bias on temperature levels and heating hours, like with ground ﬂoor heating vs. radiator. Therefore, historic consumption data is not an appropriate base for modelling of energy systems with long prospect. The present research work proposes a novel top-down methodology for generating aggregated load curves on heat demand, with a focus on residential space heating. Maps of population density distribution combined with norm temperature proﬁles and the deﬁnition of heating degree days provides a tempo-spatial map of heating demand. The knowledge of total residential space heating demand is used to identify the aggregated demand curve, suitable for energy system modelling.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a non-stationary stochastic generator for radar rainfall ﬁelds based on the short-space Fourier transform (SSFT). The statistical properties of rainfall ﬁelds often exhibit signiﬁcant spatial heterogeneity due to variability in the involved physical processes and inﬂuence of orographic forcing. The traditional approach to simulate stochastic rainfall ﬁelds based on the Fourier ﬁltering of white noise is only able to reproduce the global power spectrum and spatial autocorrelation of the precipitation ﬁelds. Conceptually similar to wavelet analysis, the SSFT is a simple and effective extension of the Fourier transform developed for space–frequency localisation, which allows for using windows to better capture the local statistical structure of rainfall. The SSFT is used to generate stochastic noise and precipitation ﬁelds that replicate the local spatial correlation structure, i.e. anisotropy and correlation range, of the observed radar rainfall ﬁelds. The potential of the stochastic generator is demonstrated using four precipitation cases observed by the fourth generation of Swiss weather radars that display signiﬁcant non-stationarity due to the coexistence of stratiform and convective precipitation, differential rotation of the weather system and locally varying anisotropy. The generator is veriﬁed in its ability to reproduce both the global and the local Fourier power spectra of the precipitation ﬁeld. The SSFT-based stochastic generator can be applied and extended to improve the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation, design storm simulation, stochastic numerical weather prediction (NWP) downscaling, and also for other geophysical applications involving the simulation of complex nonstationary ﬁelds.},

Considering the complementary characteristics of various RES, this paper proposes a short-term optimization model for cascade hydropower stations coupled with renewable-based generations including wind and photovoltaic (PV). Based on autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model and copula function, a joint distribution model for power output of wind and PV is built with measured data and substantial scenarios are produced. Due to the nonlinear curve of forebay elevation - reservoir volume and tailwater elevation - water flow in hydropower stations, several linearization approaches are used to reformulate the optimization model into a tractable form. Hydraulic relationship and time delay of water flow between cascade reservoirs are established to make full use of the controllable complementarity of hydropower generations, and the variability of wind and PV power output can be mitigated. A basin in southwest China with wind farms and solar arrays is chosen as a detailed study case. The simulation results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Energy demand modelling needs to go beyond annual and national scale for being able to analyse today’s complex energy systems. Increasing the spatial resolution enables capturing the spatial dynamics of drivers of energy demand and regional matching of supply and demand. Increasing the temporal resolution is crucial to model demand management or capture differences in load profiles due to the introduction of new technologies such as heat pumps. A high-resolution bottom-up engineering energy demand simulation framework is introduced, which projects energy demands on a high spatial and temporal scale. The framework is applied for studying the electrification of heat by a large-scale uptake of heat pumps for water and space heating in the United Kingdom and to explore potential demand management opportunities. We simulate an uptake of 50\% for water and space heating until 2050. Depending on population, efficiency and heat pump diffusion scenarios, we simulate considerable regional differences of changes in peak electricity demand. On a national scale, change in peak electricity is simulated to be between 17\% and 43\% for unmanaged heat pump load profiles. Potential electricity peak reductions by managed electric load profile of heat pumps for water heating lies between 1.3\% and 4.2\% (1.8 –2.1 GW) and range between 11.1\% and 13.4\% (6.9 – 7 GW) for space and water heating.},

The proposed method uses both well-established models and data collected from the particular area where the photovoltaic panels will be installed and is built upon four steps. In the first step, the recorded data are used in order to select the most accurate, among several isotropic and anisotropic models that can be found in the literature, for predicting diffuse solar irradiance on inclined surfaces. In the second step, the recorded data and the selected model are used to construct a database that contains the averages and the variances of the hourly global solar irradiance on tilted surfaces over specific periods of time, for various tilt angles and orientations. In the third step, the database of the previous step is utilized to produce meta-models that correlate tilt angle and orientation with mean global irradiance and its variance on tilted surfaces. Finally, an optimization problem is formulated, aiming to determining the optimum values of tilt angle and orientation, taking into account the constraints and limitations of the system.},

Aside from heavily investing in additional storage capacities, an interesting solution might be the use predictive control methods to shift controllable loads towards production periods. Therefore, this paper introduces a systematic approach to provide a preliminary evaluation of the thermo-economic impact of model predictive control (MPC) when being applied to modern and complex building energy systems (BES). The proposed method applies an e-constraint multi-objective optimization to generate a large panel of different BES configurations and their respective operating strategies. The problem formulation relies on a holistic BES framework to satisfy the different building service requirements using a mixed integer linear programming technique. In order to illustrate the contribution of MPC, different applications on the single and multi-dwelling level are presented and analysed. The results suggest that MPC can facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources within the built environment by adjusting the heating and cooling demand to the fluctuating renewable generation, increasing the share of self-consumption by up to 27\% while decreasing the operating expenses by up to 3\% on the single building level. Finally, a preliminary assessment of the national-wide potential is performed by means of an extended implementation on the Swiss building stock.},

	abstract = {Optimizing wind power generation and controlling the operation of wind turbines to efficiently harness the renewable wind energy is a challenging task due to the intermittency and unpredictable nature of wind speed, which has significant influence on wind power production. A new approach for long-term wind speed forecasting is developed in this study by integrating GMCM (Gaussian mixture copula model) and localized GPR (Gaussian process regression). The time series of wind speed is first classified into multiple non-Gaussian components through the Gaussian mixture copula model and then Bayesian inference strategy is employed to incorporate the various non-Gaussian components using the posterior probabilities. Further, the localized Gaussian process regression models corresponding to different non-Gaussian components are built to characterize the stochastic uncertainty and non-stationary seasonality of the wind speed data. The various localized GPR models are integrated through the posterior probabilities as the weightings so that a global predictive model is developed for the prediction of wind speed. The proposed GMCM–GPR approach is demonstrated using wind speed data from various wind farm locations and compared against the GMCM-based ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average) and SVR (support vector regression) methods. In contrast to GMCM–ARIMA and GMCM–SVR methods, the proposed GMCM–GPR model is able to well characterize the multi-seasonality and uncertainty of wind speed series for accurate long-term prediction.},

First, the main assumptions behind the simplified model are presented. Then, CitySim is compared to other detailed simulation tools on case studies defined in the Building Energy Simulation Test (BESTEST) validation procedure. Finally, the predictions of CitySim regarding the annual heating load are compared with the monitored consumption of a building located on the campus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). Regarding the BESTEST, CitySim gives annual heating and cooling results together with peak heating and cooling loads that are within the acceptable range defined by reference simulation tools except for the annual heating load of case 960 and the peak cooling of case 610 but the differences are rather small (less than 1\%). Regarding the EPFL campus building, CitySim gives an annual heating consumption within a 5\% range of the monitored consumption of two reference years. The paper concludes that despite its simplified thermal model, CitySim results remain consistent with more detailed programs and the monitored heating consumption of an office building. These results reinforce the confidence in the tool to predict annual and peak load energy needs for conditioning buildings. Walter, Emmanuel; Kämpf, Jérôme Henri},

Levelized Energy Cost (LEC), Initial Capital Cost (ICC), Grid Integration Level (GI), Levelized CO2 emission (LCO2), utilization of renewable energy, flexibility of the system, loss of load probability (LOLP) are considered as criteria used to assess the design. The novel approach consists of several steps. Pareto analysis is conducted initially using 2D Pareto fronts to reduce the dimensions of the optimization problem. Subsequently, Pareto multi objective optimization is conducted considering LEC, GI and ICC which were identified as the best set of objective functions to represent the design requirements. Next, fuzzy TOPSIS and level diagrams are used for multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) considering the set of criteria and the boundary matrix that represents the design requirements of the application. Pareto analysis shows that 5D optimization problem can be reduced to a 3D optimization problem when considering LEC, ICC and GI as the objective functions. Finally, results obtained from the case study shows that the novel method can be used design distributed energy systems considering a set of criteria which is beyond the reach of Pareto optimization with different priority levels.},

We present a general method (G.POT) for the determination of shallow geothermal potentials. This method was derived using a comprehensive set of analytical heat transfer simulations, performed by varying (i) the thermal properties of the ground, which comprise its thermal conductivity and capacity, (ii) the thermal properties of the borehole, and (iii) the operational and design parameters of the plant, namely, the BHE length, the threshold temperature of the heat carrier ﬂuid, the duration of the heating/cooling season and the simulated lifetime. Therefore, the G.POT method is a simple and ﬂexible tool that can be implemented in a wide range of different scenarios for large-scale mapping of geothermal potentials. We also assess G.POT by discussing its application to map the geothermal yield in the Province of Cuneo (Piemonte, NW Italy).},

In this more dynamic energy system, deployment of energy storage at the site of consumption is envisioned to create synergies with the local distributed generation (DG) system. From a large end-user perspective, this paper contributes to the practical understanding of smart grids by modelling the impact of real-time pricing schemes (smart grids) on a hybrid DG system (mixed generation for heating and electricity loads) coupled with storage units. Speciﬁcally, we address: How does the portfolio of DG units affect the value of energy storage? and, what is the value of energy storage when assessing different designs of demand response for the end-user? To this end, we formulate a dynamic optimization model to represent a reallife urban community’s energy system composed of a co-generation unit, gas boilers, electrical heaters and a wind turbine. We discuss the techno-economic beneﬁts of complementing this end-user’s energy system with storage units (thermal storage and battery devices). The paper analyses the storages policy strategies to simultaneously satisfy heat and electricity demand through the efﬁcient use of DG units under demand response mechanisms. Results indicate that the storage units reduce energy costs by 7–10\% in electricity and 3\% in gas charges. In cases with a large DG capacity, the supply–demand mismatch increases, making storage more valuable.},

It is shown here that random forests provide information about the full conditional distribution of the response variable, not only about the conditional mean. Conditional quantiles can be inferred with quantile regression forests, a generalisation of random forests. Quantile regression forests give a non-parametric and accurate way of estimating conditional quantiles for high-dimensional predictor variables. The algorithm is shown to be consistent.

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have received increasing attention over the last few years. They were initially conceived for image categorization, i.e., the problem of assigning a semantic label to an entire input image. In this paper we address the problem of dense semantic labeling, which consists in assigning a semantic label to every pixel in an image. Since this requires a high spatial accuracy to determine where labels are assigned, categorization CNNs, intended to be highly robust to local deformations, are not directly applicable. By adapting categorization networks, many semantic labeling CNNs have been recently proposed. Our first contribution is an in-depth analysis of these architectures. We establish the desired properties of an ideal semantic labeling CNN, and assess how those methods stand with regard to these properties. We observe that even though they provide competitive results, these CNNs often underexploit properties of semantic labeling that could lead to more effective and efficient architectures. Out of these observations, we then derive a CNN framework specifically adapted to the semantic labeling problem. In addition to learning features at different resolutions, it learns how to combine these features. By integrating local and global information in an efficient and flexible manner, it outperforms previous techniques. We evaluate the proposed framework and compare it with state-of-the-art architectures on public benchmarks of high-resolution aerial image labeling.},

	abstract = {Given the challenges related to climate change and dependency from fossil fuels, modification of the energy systems infrastructure to increase the share of renewable energy is a priority in urban energy planning. The high heating density in cities makes it more economically competitive to deploy district heating (DH), which is essential for large-scale integration of renewable energy sources. Combining georeferenced data with district heating design methods allows to improve the quality of the system design. However, increasing the spatial resolution can lead to intractable model sizes. This paper presents a methodology to spatially assess the integration of DH networks in urban energy systems. Given georeferenced data of buildings, resource availability and road networks, the methodology allows the identification of promising sites for DH deployment. First, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model divides the urban system into spatial clusters (of buildings). Graph theory and routing methods are then used to optimally design the DH configuration in each cluster considering the road network in the routing algorithm. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is formulated in order to economically evaluate the DH integration over the whole urban area. The proposed methodology is applied to an example case study, evaluating the use of geothermal energy (deep aquifer) for direct heat supply. The results of the optimization show the interest of deploying geothermal DH in some of the clusters. The profitability of DH integration is strongly affected by the spatial density of the heating demand.},

At 50\% excess generation the required long-term storage energy capacity and annual balancing energy amount to 1\% of the annual consumption. The required balancing power turns out to be 25\% of the average hourly load.

Different electricity-to-thermal energy strategies to supply also heating and cooling demands were investigated to enable higher than usual RES shares through converting surplus renewable electricity into thermal energy which often constitute a major part of the end-use energy in a city. Case examples from a southern climate (Shanghai) with distributed PV schemes and a northern city (Helsinki) with off-shore seaside wind power were analyzed. The results from the Shanghai case indicate that when using thermal storage options, 2-folding of the PV capacity from the self-use limit of PV could be possible. With optimal electricity-to-thermal energy strategies and energy management, a 40–65\% solar fraction of yearly electricity could be possible. In the Helsinki climate with wind power coinciding with the seasonal load peak, RES may satisfy beyond 30\% of all energy and beyond 70\% of all electricity demand annually. The size of thermal storage needed in the above cases is between 10 and 100 GW h. A higher RES use leads to higher spatial power ﬂows and power variability in the city which requires more sophisticated control strategies and ﬂexible auxiliary power options to handle transmission bottlenecks.},

We investigate here energy systems design to increase the use of renewable electricity (RE) such as photovoltaics and wind power in cities. We analyzed the hourly temporal and spatiotemporal energy demand and supply patterns in Delhi, Shanghai and Helsinki to understand how energy systems respond to high RE shares, and to determine realizable levels of RE power. The results indicate that if limiting the RE output to the instantaneous power demand, a 20\% yearly share of electricity could be reached. Increasing the RE beyond this limit without a smart design adds only limited benefit. Adding short-term electrical storage could increase the RE share of power in Shanghai to 50–70\%, in Delhi to 40–60\%, and in Helsinki to 25–35\%. An electricity-to-thermal conversion strategy in which surplus RE power is utilized for heating, enables to increase the wind power use in Helsinki up to 64\% of the yearly electricity demand, but in addition, to cover 30\% of the yearly heat demand. Such a scheme would add ca 10\% to the overall wind power investment. A high RE share affects the existing power mix and the plant capacity factors, which need to be re-optimized. In the above cases, RE replaces fossil fuel and coal power plants and therefore the CO2 emission reductions from smart design are proportional to the RE shares shown. Smart energy system design could help mainstreaming renewable electricity as part of the cities' carbon reduction strategies.},

	abstract = {In Ontario (Canada), the integration of renewable power is a priority policy goal. Since 2004, the circumstances under which the integration of renewable power is evaluated have changed due to successive changes in price as well as concerns that its over-production may add to grid congestion. This research investigates the value of increasing complementarity (both proximate and geographically dispersed) of wind and solar resources as a means by which electricity planners and researchers might advance electricity sustainability in Ontario. More specifically, this paper asks the following questions: 1) Does the combination of solar and wind resources in selected locations in Ontario serve to ‘smooth out’ power production, i.e., decrease instances of both high and low values, as compared to either resource producing individually? 2) Can this ‘smoothness’ be further improved by dispersing these resources geographically amongst locations? and 3) Does increasing the number of locations with solar and wind resources further ‘smooth out’ power production? Three years (2003–2005) of synchronous, hourly measurements of solar irradiance and wind speeds from Environment Canada’s Canadian Weather Energy and Engineering Data Sets (CWEEDS) are used to derive dimensionless indices for four locations in Ontario (Toronto, Wiarton, Sault Ste. Marie and Ottawa). These indices are used to develop three transparent and accessible methods of analysis: (1) graphical representation; (2) percentile ranking; and (3) using a theoretical maximum as a proxy for capacity. The article concludes that the combination of solar and wind within locations and amongst two locations improves ‘smoothness’ in power production, as compared to when each resource is produced on its own; moreover, it is further improved once more than two resources and two locations are combined. However, there is neither further benefit, nor drawback, associated with the geographic dispersion of complementarity between solar in one location and wind in another, when compared to both resources in one location.},

To quantify general features of such a weather dependent electricity supply in the contiguous US, wind and solar PV generation data are calculated, based on 32 years of weather data with temporal resolution of 1h and spatial resolution of 40×40km2, assuming site-suitability-based and stochastic wind and solar capacity distributions. The regional wind-and-solar mixes matching load and generation closest on seasonal timescales cluster around 80\% solar share, owing to the US summer load peak. This mix more than halves long-term storage requirements, compared to wind only. The mixes matching generation and load best on daily timescales lie at about 80\% wind share, due to the nightly gap in solar production. Going from solar only to this mix reduces backup energy needs by about 50\%. Furthermore, we calculate shifts in FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)-level LCOE (Levelized Costs Of Electricity) for wind and solar PV due to differing weather conditions. Regional LCOE vary by up to 29\%, and LCOE-optimal mixes largely follow resource quality. A transmission network enhancement among FERC regions is constructed to transfer high penetrations of solar and wind across FERC boundaries, employing a novel least-cost optimization.},

Knowledge of the amount of insolation at various geographic locations is desirable for application in such diverse fields as solar energy utilization, civil engineering, agriculture, forestry, meteorology, environmental assessment, and ecological research. For most geographical areas, however, insolation data are not available. Simple interpolation and extrapolation of point–specific measurements are typically not feasible, because insolation can vary significantly within short distances due to topographic heterogeneity and nearground features. While some geographical information systems (GIS) based solar radiation modeling capabilities have been developed, there is a need for expanded functionality, accuracy, and calculation speed. We developed the Solar Analyst as an ArcView GIS extension, using C++, Avenue, and the GridIO library. The Solar Analyst is a comprehensive geometric solar radiation modeling tool. It calculates insolation maps using digital elevation models (DEMs) for input. Highly optimized algorithms account for the influences of the viewshed, surface orientation, elevation, and atmospheric conditions. The Solar Analyst model was validated by comparing calculated temporal and spatial patterns of insolation in the vicinity of Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) with detailed monitoring of insolation, weather, and vegetation.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the City Energy Analyst (CEA), a computational framework for the analysis and optimization of energy systems in neighborhoods and city districts. The framework allows analyzing the energy, carbon and financial benefits of multiple urban design scenarios in conjunction to optimal schemes of distributed generation. For this, the framework integrates time-dependent methods for building energy performance simulation, conversion and storage technologies simulation, assessment of local energy potentials, bi-level energy systems optimization and multi-criteria analysis. Based on past research, the framework introduces a novel interface to facilitate the spatiotemporal analysis of patterns of demand and potential infrastructure solutions. The model was programmed in Python v2.7 and built as an extension of the Geographic Information System ArcGIS v10.3, which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. We present an application of the model for a downtown area in Switzerland where we evaluated four trajectories of development and found optimum infrastructure solutions for their operation. For a more holistic approach we used the 2000-W/1-t CO2 society vision concept to compare the environmental performance of these solutions with that of embodied energy in buildings and transportation systems. From the optimization process, most infrastructure solutions showed an average integration of 50\% to 80\% of buildings in thermal micro-grids, 50 to 100\% of the available solar potential, and a resource mix consisting of photovoltaic electricity and sources of waste and ambient heat. For a balanced distribution of social, environmental and economic criteria, the results showed potential relative savings in the area from 45\% to 60\% in emissions and from 25\% to 50\% in primary energy at an annualized cost between 14\% and 44\% higher than today. For an economic-driven distribution, the results showed savings of up to 23\% in emissions, 36\% in primary energy and 11\% in costs. We identified close to 15\% in emissions and 20\% in primary energy savings with variable costs between −2\% and 23\% in the area are strongly related to the urban design option rather than to its optimal energy system. In comparison to local benchmarks, the environmental impact of buildings during operation lies between that of embodied energy in buildings and mobility in the service sector (business flights). We estimated that an increase in close to 4\% of today's average efficiency of photovoltaic technology would allow the area to comply with those local benchmarks. On the other hand, we concluded the suitability of the City Energy Analyst (CEA) to assist urban planning authorities looking for both design and engineering options to increase the performance of their neighborhoods and city districts.},

Although there are widely used Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) techniques and platforms, they often require manual work from technical and domain experts at different stages of the process. When confronted with the 4 V’s of big data (volume, velocity, variety and veracity), manual intervention may make ETL prohibitively expensive.

The hybrid system is a better option for construction of modern electrical grids that includes economic, environmental and social beneﬁts. An overview of different distributed generation technologies has been presented. This paper puts forward a comprehensive review of optimal sizing, energy management, operating and control strategies and integration of different renewable energy sources to constitute a hybrid system.

	abstract = {A consistent, agreed-upon terminology is prerequisite for geothermal resource assessment. Accordingly, we propose a logical, sequential subdivision of the “geothermal resource base”, accepting its definition as all the thermal energy in the earth's crust under a given area, measured from mean annual temperature. That part of the resource base which is shallow enough to be tapped by production drilling is termed the “accessible resource base”, and it in turn is divided into “useful” and “residual” components. The useful component (i.e. the thermal energy that could reasonably be extracted at costs competitive with other forms of energy at some specified future time) is termed the “geothermal resource”. This in turn is divided into “economic” and “subeconomic” components, based on conditions existing at the time of assessment. In the format of a McKelvey diagram, this logic defines the vertical axis (degree of economic feasibility). The horizontal axis (degree of geologic assurance) contains “identified” and “undiscovered” components. “Reserve” is then designated as the identified economic resource. All categories should be expressed in units of thermal energy, with resource and reserve figures calculated at wellhead, prior to the inevitable large losses inherent in any practical thermal use or in conversion to electricity. Methods for assessing geothermal resources can be grouped into 4 classes: (a) surface thermal flux, (b) volume, (c) planar fracture and (d) magmatic heat budget. The volume method appears to be most useful because (1) it is applicable to virtually any geologic environment, (2) the required parameters can in Sprinciple be measured or estimated, (3) the inevitable errors are in part compensated and (4) the major uncertainties (recoverability and resupply) are amenable to resolution in the foreseeable future. The major weakness in all the methods rests in the estimation of how much of the accessible resource base can be extracted at some time in the future. In a manner similar to mineral and fuel assessment, this recoverability is expressed as a “recovery factor”. For an ideally permeable hot-water system, the recovery factor may be as much as 50\% and seems to be independent of temperature. It must decrease as effective porosity (φe) decreases, but the relation between the two is little more than a guess. On the other hand, for favorable systems like Larderello that produce steam by a mechanism of intergranular vaporization, the recovery factor is probably around 15–20\%, decreasing to zero at an effective porosity of zero. According to the anlysis of Bodvarsson (1974), it increases with decreasing reservoir temperature, and as pointed out by Nathenson (1975a) is limited at low temperatures by the need to have sufficient reservoir pressure for extraction and use. The extent to which a geothermal reservoir can be resupplied with heat during “industrial” times of 10–100 yr can be evaluated using simple analytical models. The results, combined with gravity and levelling data of Hunt (1977) for Wairakei and Isherwood (1977) for The Geysers, confirm earlier conclusions by Ramey (1970) and Nathenson (1975a) that resupply to reservoirs producing only steam can be neglected, and the conclusion of Nathenson (1975a) that it may be significant for hot-water systems of high natural discharge. Major subjects that demand continuing investigation include: 1.1. Determination of recovery factors as functions of temperature and effective porosity, particularly for hot-water systems.2.2. Evaluation of fluid recharge and heat resupply by repetitive gravity, levelling and underground temperature surveys in producing geothermal fields.3.3. Analysis of the extent to which a recovery factor can be enhanced by stimulation and by use of confined circulation loops.},

	abstract = {Hybrid ground source heat pump (HGSHP) system coupled with supplemental heat rejection equipment in parallel configuration is suitable for buildings where the cooling load is much higher than the heating load. Appropriate control is expected to improve its energy efficiency. A control strategy is proposed for cooling season as to compare the temperatures of the water exiting the ground heat exchanger (GHE) and the cooling tower (CT) directly. The logic is to choose the GHE or the CT to reject the condensing heat whenever the corresponding exit cooling water temperature is lower. During operation such a HGSHP system requires the knowledge of both the exit temperatures to take the shift control action. In many situations, however, only one of the two exit temperatures is measurable because only one is working at one moment. This paper develops artificial neural network (ANN) models for predicting the temperature of the water exiting the GHE. A numerical simulation package of a HGSHP system is adopted for training and testing the model. These models are also optimized regarding inputs, learning algorithms and neurons in the hidden layers. Results show that the ANN model can predict the GHE exit temperature with an absolute error less than 0.2°C.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new frequency domain method to model the heat transfer between the injected/ extracted heat and the temperature of the ﬂuid exiting a borehole heat exchanger. The method is based on in situ measurements and focuses particularly on the short-term borehole heat transfer. It uses a rational function of the Warburg variable in the Laplace domain to model the borehole heat transfer. The rational model is transformed to a time domain model using inverse Laplace transformation. This time domain model makes it possible to calculate the temperature response on a random heat variation signal. The paper also demonstrates a new way to perform the classical thermal response test. Instead of injecting a constant amount of heat, the experiments have been performed using multiple short-duration heat injections. In this way, the obtained rational heat transfer model contains information about both the short- and the long-term heat transfer. The results obtained using the proposed modeling method are compared with those obtained from a state-of-the-art analytical method. The time domain model can be used to design a controller to optimize the performance of a Ground Source Heat Pump system, the efﬁciency of which depends strongly on the temperature of the ﬂuid exiting the borehole.},

The combination with solar collectors has been introduced to reduce the electricity demand in the system. In order to analyze different systems with combinations of solar collectors and ground-source heat pumps, computer simulations have been carried out with the simulation program TRNSYS. Large differences were found between the system alternatives. The optimal design is when solar heat produces domestic hot water during summertime and recharges the borehole during wintertime. The advantage is related to the rate of heat extraction from the borehole as well as the overall design of the system. The demand of electricity may increase with solar recharging, because of the increased operating time of the circulation pumps. Another advantage with solar heat in combination with heat pumps is when the boreholes or neighbouring installations are drilled so close that they thermally influence each other. This may lead to decreasing temperatures in the ground, which gives decreased performance of the heat pump and increased use of electricity. The net annual heat extraction from the ground is reduced by recharge from solar heat.},

	abstract = {A major problem faced by many standalone geothermal power plants, particularly in hot and arid climates such as Australia, is the adverse effects of diurnal temperature change on the operation of air-cooled condensers which typically leads to fluctuation in the power output and degradation of thermal efficiency. This study is concerned with the assessment of hybrid solar–geothermal power plants as a means of boosting the power output and where possible moderating the impact of diurnal temperature change. The ultimate goal is to explore the potential benefits from the synergies between the solar and geothermal energy sources. For this purpose the performances of the hybrid systems in terms of power output and the cost of electricity were compared with that of stand-alone solar and geothermal plants. Moreover, the influence of various controlling parameters including the ambient temperature, solar irradiance, geographical location, resource quality, and the operating mode of the power cycle on the performance of the hybrid system were investigated under steady-state conditions. Unsteady-state case studies were also performed to examine the dynamic behaviour of hybrid systems. These case studies were carried out for three different Australian geographic locations using raw hourly meteorological data of a typical year. The process simulation package Aspen-HYSYS was used to simulate plant configurations of interest. Thermodynamic analyses carried out for a reservoir temperature of 120°C and a fixed brine flow rate of 50kg/s revealed that under Australian climatic conditions (with a typical ambient temperature of 31°C in summer) a hybrid plant would outperform stand-alone geothermal and solar power plants if at least 68\% of its energy input is met by solar energy (i.e. a solar energy fraction of ≈68\%). This figure drops to about 19\% for reservoir temperatures greater than 170°C. Case studies also showed that, for a mid-range reservoir temperature of 150°C, the cost of electricity production can be reduced by 20\% when a hybrid plant is used instead of the stand-alone Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS).},

Shading behavior was considered and suitable roof sections for solar PV installations selected using a multi-criteria objective. At sub-meter resolution and small time steps the effect of occlusion from near object was determined. Annual daily horizontal irradiation values were refined at 0.55m resolution and were shown to be lower than those obtained at 90m by 30\%. The robustness of r.sun as capable of working with different levels of surface complexity has been confirmed.

These indicators are conveniently related to one another. In comparing simulations of sky view factor with those of simulated solar irradiation, which itself relates well to illumination, this paper tests the effectiveness of all three – based on analysis of three existing Swiss districts. From this, it is concluded that the absence of treatment of direct solar radiation, sky anisotropy or reflected radiation seriously impairs the ability of the Vs-related indicators to offer meaningful insights regarding natural radiation potential in the localised case. Predictions of annual irradiation from aggregations of Vs also perform badly, but the aggregate Vs does correlate reasonably well with irradiation so that judgements of overall radiation availability may be made with some confidence.},

Data sets of measured hourly insolation values were obtained over a 6-month period using pyranometers which received diffuse and total solar radiation on a horizontal plane and total radiation on surfaces tilted toward the equator at 37° and 60° angles above the horizon. Data on the horizontal surfaces were used in the insolation models to predict insolation on the tilted surface; comparisons of measured vs calculated insolation on the tilted surface were examined to test the validity of the sky light approximations. It was found that the Liu-Jordan isotropic distribution model provides a good fit to empirical data under overcast skies but underestimates the amount of solar radiation incident on tilted surfaces under clear and partly cloudy conditions. The anisotropic-clear-sky distribution model by Temps and Coulson provides a good prediction for clear skies but overstimates the solar radiation when used for cloudy days. An anisotropic-all-sky model was formulated in this effort which provided excellent agreement between measured and predicted insolation throughout the 6-month period.},

	abstract = {Geothermal energy is an efficient low carbon solution for the heating and cooling of buildings. For many megacities such as London and Beijing, the amount of energy that can be stored in the urban local subsurface is greater than their annual heating and cooling demands. The ground source heat pump (GSHP) system – a shallow geothermal technology that provides heating and cooling for buildings by continuously replenishing the energy in the subsurface – has been used increasingly in recent years, but its application has been generally limited to single buildings. In this study, a geographic information system-based simulation model was developed to estimate how many GSHPs could be installed at the city scale without losing control of the ground thermal capacity and to evaluate the degree to which such a system could contribute to the energy demands of buildings in a city. The model was built by embedding a Python-based GSHP design code into ArcGIS software and was trialled on the City of Westminster, a borough in London, UK, as a case study under the two scenarios of boreholes placed under buildings and boreholes around buildings. Under both scenarios, the model produced borehole allocation maps and ratio of capacity to demand maps. The results show that a large proportion of buildings could support their own heating demands through GSHPs and, through a well-organised district heating system, GSHPs may be used efficiently to satisfy heating demands throughout an urban area.},

The methodology consists of three subsequent parts: First, spatiotemporal data sets of electricity demand for single-family houses in rural and low-density urban areas are generated. Second, spatiotemporal data sets of photovoltaics potential are computed based on (a) a technical photovoltaics model, (b) two decades of hourly solar irradiance and temperature data, and (c) snow cover data from the Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility. Third, a linear optimization model serves to define photovoltaics and battery systems sizes and to generate the corresponding maps. The resulting maps cover Germany and the Czech Republic and are generated for 18 technical and weather-dependent scenarios. The results show how challenging it could be to achieve complete independence from the grid in certain locations. Especially relevant for the sizing of the systems are long periods (several days in a row) of low photovoltaic energy generation due to overcast sky conditions or snow cover of the panels. Furthermore, the results offer a scientifically based source of information for sizing photovoltaics and battery systems in the two countries.},

This research study determined the solar energy potential in Andalusia for grid-connected photovoltaic systems installed on residential rooftops. A methodology was developed for this purpose, which first involved a description of building characteristics, followed by the calculation of the useful roof surface area where photovoltaic arrays could be installed. In the next phase of the study, the mean solar irradiation characteristics were defined as well as the technical parameters of the photovoltaic systems. All of these factors allowed us to estimate the amount of electricity that could be potentially generated per year by solar panels.},

	abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has matured to become a technically viable large-scale source of sustainable energy. Understanding the rooftop PV potential is critical for utility planning, accommodating grid capacity, deploying financing schemes and formulating future adaptive energy policies. This paper demonstrates techniques to merge the capabilities of geographic information systems and object-specific image recognition to determine the available rooftop area for PV deployment in an example large-scale region in south eastern Ontario. A five-step procedure has been developed for estimating total rooftop PV potential which involves geographical division of the region; sampling using the Feature Analyst extraction software; extrapolation using roof area-population relationships; reduction for shading, other uses and orientation; and conversion to power and energy outputs. Limitations faced in terms of the capabilities of the software and determining the appropriate fraction of roof area available are discussed. Because this aspect of the analysis uses an integral approach, PV potential will not be georeferenced, but rather presented as an agglomerate value for use in regional policy making. A relationship across the region was found between total roof area and population of 70.0m2/capita±6.2\%. With appropriate roof tops covered with commercial solar cells, the potential PV peak power output from the region considered is 5.74GW (157\% of the region’s peak power demands) and the potential annual energy production is 6909GWh (5\% of Ontario’s total annual demand). This suggests that 30\% of Ontario’s energy demand can be met with province-wide rooftop PV deployment. This new understanding of roof area distribution and potential PV outputs will guide energy policy formulation in Ontario and will inform future research in solar PV deployment and its geographical potential.},

	abstract = {A rigorously founded assessment of the potential of renewable energies is essential for the development of energy policies and regulations. Usually, a hierarchy of potentials are calculated which gradually include restrictions for the use of a specific renewable resource. This paper deals with the estimation of the technical potential of roof-integrated photovoltaic systems. The most restrictive step when estimating this potential for large-scale territories is the estimation of the roof available area in existing buildings, for which no direct data exists. The methodology proposed in this paper allows to estimate the roof area available for solar applications and also quantify the error made in this estimation. It is based on easily accessible data (such as land uses and population and building densities) and on a statistically representative stratified-sample of vectorial GIS maps of urban areas. The main point in this sampling process is that the stratification is done based on a finite set of average building typologies which comprises every urban area in the region of study. An interesting characteristic emerging from the proposed methodology is its scalability and the possibility of being used from regional to continental scales. This methodology is applied in this work to Spain and a mean available area for photovoltaic equipment on roofs of 14.0±4.5m2/ca. with a confidence level of 95\% is obtained. Additionally, results are given for the technical limit of production of roof-integrated photovoltaic energy.},

	abstract = {Geothermal Heat Pumps, or Ground Coupled Heat Pumps (GCHP), are systems combining a heat pump with a ground heat exchanger (closed loop systems), or fed by ground water from a well (open loop systems). They use the earth as a heat source when operating in heating mode, with a fluid (usually water or a water–antifreeze mixture) as the medium that transfers the heat from the earth to the evaporator of the heat pump, thus utilising geothermal energy. In cooling mode, they use the earth as a heat sink. With Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHE), geothermal heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling at virtually any location, with great flexibility to meet any demands. More than 20 years of R\&D focusing on BHE in Europe has resulted in a well-established concept of sustainability for this technology, as well as sound design and installation criteria. Recent developments are the Thermal Response Test, which allows in-situ-determination of ground thermal properties for design purposes, and thermally enhanced grouting materials to reduce borehole thermal resistance. For cooling purposes, but also for the storage of solar or waste heat, the concept of underground thermal energy storage (UTES) could prove successful. Systems can be either open (aquifer storage) or can use BHE (borehole storage). Whereas cold storage is already established on the market, heat storage, and, in particular, high temperature heat storage ({\textgreater} 50 °C) is still in the demonstration phase. Despite the fact that geothermal heat pumps have been in use for over 50 years now (the first were in the USA), market penetration of this technology is still in its infancy, with fossil fuels dominating the space heating market and air-to-air heat pumps that of space cooling. In Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, France and the USA, large numbers of geothermal heat pumps are already operational, and installation guidelines, quality control and contractor certification are now major issues of debate.},

Integrating non-dispatchable renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy is vital in this context. Distributed generation has been identified as a promising method to integrate Solar PV (SPV) and wind energy into grid in recent literature. Distributed generation using grid-tied electrical hubs, which consist of Internal Combustion Generator (ICG), non-dispatchable energy sources (i.e., wind turbines and SPV panels) and energy storage for providing the electricity demand in Sri Lanka is considered in this study. A novel dispatch strategy is introduced to address the limitations in the existing methods in optimizing grid-integrated electrical hubs considering real time pricing of the electricity grid and curtailments in grid integration. Multi-objective optimization is conducted for the system design considering grid integration level and Levelized Energy Cost (LEC) as objective functions to evaluate the potential of electrical hubs to integrate SPV and wind energy. The sensitivity of grid curtailments, energy market, price of wind turbines and SPV panels on Pareto front is evaluated subsequently. Results from the Pareto analysis demonstrate the potential of electrical hubs to cover more than 60\% of the annual electricity demand from SPV and wind energy considering stringent grid curtailments. Such a share from SPV and wind energy is quite significant when compared to direct grid integration of non-dispatchable renewable energy technologies.},

Research in the optimal design of HESs is ongoing, with numerous optimization techniques giving special emphasis to Pareto optimization, incorporating conflicting objectives. The subsequent decision-making process including the non-dominant set of solutions has yet to be addressed. This work focuses on combining multi-objective optimization with a multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) technique to support decision makers in the process of designing HESs. Four different objectives, i.e., levelized energy cost (LEC), unmet load fraction, wasted renewable energy (WRE) and fuel consumption are used to obtain the Pareto front. A decision support tool based on Fuzzy TOPSIS and level diagrams is proposed to analyze the Pareto front and support the subsequent decision-making activity. A case study is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. The study shows that the novel method is useful when determining the relative weights of objectives, providing a detailed picture of the objective space to the designer when coming up with the optimum system. The technique proposed in this study can be further extended to analyze similar problems in energy system design where MCDM is necessary after multi-objective optimization.},

	abstract = {Solar radiation forecasting is an important part of planning and sizing of a photovoltaic power plant. Yearly measured hourly solar radiation data on the surface of a region include both stochastic and deterministic behaviors. The deterministic part comes from the solar geometry whereas the stochastic part is occurred due to random atmospheric events such as the motion of clouds etc. Moving from these facts, in this paper two different adaptive approaches are developed and tested for hourly solar radiation forecasting. In ﬁrst approach, the data is separated into seasons. For winter and summer season it is thought that linear predictors work better due to rare alterations for short time periods. For these seasons linear prediction approach is adopted and used. On the other hand bigger alterations are most probable for spring and fall seasons. Therefore, for these seasons an empirical method is employed. In second approach, clearness index is considered as a decision maker to decide whether linear or empirical method will be used as a predictor. This decision is adopted for each prediction. It is obtained from the results that such an adoptive method outperforms non adoptive ones.},

Before forecasting the solar systems output, it is essential to focus the prediction on the solar irradiance. The global solar radiation forecasting can be performed by several methods; the two big categories are the cloud imagery combined with physical models, and the machine learning models. In this context, the objective of this paper is to give an overview of forecasting methods of solar irradiation using machine learning approaches. Although, a lot of papers describes methodologies like neural networks or support vector regression, it will be shown that other methods (regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting and many others) begin to be used in this context of prediction. The performance ranking of such methods is complicated due to the diversity of the data set, time step, forecasting horizon, set up and performance indicators. Overall, the error of prediction is quite equivalent. To improve the prediction performance some authors proposed the use of hybrid models or to use an ensemble forecast approach.},

	abstract = {As part of its ambitious long term energy strategy, Switzerland plans to phase out nuclear power production and replace most or all of its signiﬁcant share of national electricity production (40\%) by renewables, in particular by photovoltaics (PV) and wind energy. The existing large fraction of hydropower and signiﬁcant pumped-storage hydro capacity in the mountainous regions of the country will potentially provide valuable balancing and ancillary services for the management of intermittent production from PV and wind. We present a set of calculations based on data from the current Swiss electricity system, which investigate the effect of different PV-wind mixing ratio scenarios on required import and export from foreign neighbors. It is shown that the current hydropower is a good basis to deal with intermittent energy sources and to keep import rates of electricity at current levels in a fully renewable Switzerland as long as the PV-wind ratio is small. For higher PV-shares, forced export and import will increase but appear acceptable if PV-contribution stays below 0.6. Enlargement of reservoir capacity or oversizing of intermittent renewables can further reduce required import effectively. These ﬁndings are quantitatively speciﬁc for Switzerland but qualitatively transferable to similar mountainous environments with abundant hydropower resources.},

This model is one of those used currently to estimate short time step (hourly or less) irradiance on tilted planes based on global and direct (or diffuse) irradiance. It has been shown to perform more accurately than other models for a large number of locations worldwide. The key assumptions defining the model remain basically unchanged. These include (1) a description of the sky dome featuring a circumsolar zone and horizon zone superimposed over an isotropic background, and (2) a parameterization of insolation conditions (based on availableinputs to the model), determining the value of the radiant power originating from these two zones. Operational modifications performed on the model are presented in a step by step approach. Each change isjustified on the basis of increased ease of use and/or overall accuracy. Two years of hourly data on tilted planes from two climatically distinct sites in France are used to verify performance accuracy. The isotropic, Hay and Klucher models are used as reference. Major changes include (1) the simplification of the governing equation by use of reduced brightness coefficients; (2) the allowance for negative coefficients; (3) reduction of the horizon band to an arc-of-great-circle; (4) optimization of the circumsolar region width; and (5) optimization of insolation conditions parameterization.},

	abstract = {Integrated spatial and energy planning has become a major ﬁeld of interest to meet the current renewable energy share expansion and CO2 emissions reduction targets. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) play a considerable role in supporting decision making in this ﬁeld. Solar potential maps are a popular strategy to promote renewable energy generation through photovoltaic (PV) panel installations at city and municipal scales. They indicate the areas of roofs that would provide the maximum amount of energy in kW h per year. These are often used to suggest ‘‘optimal locations’’ for PV-panels and/or recommend system sizes to achieve a certain level of yearly autarchy. This approach is acceptable if PVs have only a minor share in the local energy supply system. However, increased PV-penetration can lead to instability of the local grid, create hazards for the security of the supply, and considerably escalate the storage and system back-up requirements. To obtain a proper understanding of the consequences for the local energy balance when selecting or rejecting a certain installation, examining the hourly and intra-hourly time series of the potential energy generation from PVs is necessary. This paper introduces a GIS-based procedure to estimate the potential PV-electricity generation time series for every roof-top section within a study area using open source software. This procedure is complemented by a series of strategies to select suitable PV-installations considering the time series analysis of supply and demand. Furthermore, thirteen technical indicators are considered to evaluate the PV-installation sets selected with every strategy. The capabilities of the procedure are tested using data from a German rural municipality. The proposed procedure constitutes an efﬁcient and accessible way to assess solar potentials at the municipal scale and to design roof-top PV exploitation plans, which are more appropriate to fulﬁll the local energy requirements.},

In this work, a more comprehensive numerical model has been employed to evaluate the available amount of shallow geothermal energy by using Borehole Heat Exchanger coupled Ground Source Heat Pump systems. Numerical experiments have been performed by simulating the long-term evolution of the subsurface temperature field, which is subject to the operation of borehole heat exchangers and varying parameters like subsurface thermal conductivity and groundwater flow velocity. The concept of equivalent temperature drop is proposed as an auxiliary quantity for the subsurface. With the help of this parameter, a procedure has been established to quantify the amount of shallow geothermal potential. Following this approach, a realistic equivalent temperature reduction is found to be from −1.8 to −4.4°C in the subsurface over a period of 30years. This can be translated to an annual extractable geothermal energy value in a unit surface area, and it ranges from 3.5 to 8.6kWhm−2a−1. The exact value is site specific and heavily depends on the soil thermal conductivity, groundwater velocity, and borehole arrangement.},

As F′ is strongly influenced by the tube distance w and the absorber plate thickness δ, F′ is also correlated with the material content of absorber plus tubing. Due to the future mass production of collectors and to the restricted copper resources (in the literature, a range until 2026 is given), the role of material savings can be expected to become more and more important. This paper focuses on the correlations between F′ and the material content of absorber and tubing for flat-plate collectors with the fin-and-tube geometry. The correlations between w, δ, F′ and material content are presented in a new type of nomograph. This nomograph indicates the values of w and δ that minimize the material content (for a given F′). For a typical absorber with F′=0.90, material savings of 25\% can theoretically be achieved without any deterioration of F′, by reducing the absorber plate thickness and the tube distance. The resulting plate thickness is below 0.1 mm; the respective tube distance will be about 7 cm. Practical restrictions are discussed. In a sensitivity analysis, the influence of different parameters on F′ is investigated. The most important parameters are w, UL,δ and the Reynolds number. The technique chosen for contacting tube and absorber has only a minor influence on F′.},

	abstract = {Spatial estimates of tropical soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations and stocks are crucial to understanding the role of tropical SOC in the global carbon cycle. They also allow for spatial variation of SOC in environmental process models. SOC is spatially highly variable. In traditional approaches, SOC concentrations and stocks have been derived from estimates for single or very few profiles and spatially linked to existing units of soil or vegetation maps. However, many existing soil profile data are incomplete and untested as to whether they are representative or unbiased. Also single means for soil or vegetation map units cannot characterize SOC spatial variability within these units. We here use the digital soil mapping approach to predict the spatial distribution of SOC. This relies on a soil inference model based on spatially referenced environmental layers of topographic attributes, soil units, parent material, and forest history. We sampled soils at 165 sites, stratified according to topography and lithology, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, at depths of 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm, and 30–50 cm, and analyzed them for SOC by dry combustion. We applied Random Forest (RF) analysis as a modeling tool to the SOC data for each depth interval in order to compare vertical and lateral distribution patterns. RF has several advantages compared to other modeling approaches, for instance, the fact that it is neither sensitive to overfitting nor to noise features. The RF-based digital SOC mapping approach provided SOC estimates of high spatial resolution and estimates of error and predictor importance. The environmental variables that explained most of the variation in the topsoil (0–10 cm) were topographic attributes. In the subsoil (10–50 cm), SOC distribution was best explained by soil texture classes as derived from soil mapping units. The estimates for SOC stocks in the upper 30 cm ranged between 38 and 116 Mg ha−1, with lowest stocks on midslope and highest on toeslope positions. This digital soil mapping approach can be applied to similar landscapes to refine the spatial resolution of SOC estimates.},

	abstract = {Reliable knowledge of solar radiation is an essential requirement for designing and planning solar energy systems. Thus, this paper presents a novel hybrid model for predicting hourly global solar radiation using random forests technique and firefly algorithm. Hourly meteorological data are used to develop the proposed model. The firefly algorithm is utilized to optimize the random forests technique by finding the best number of trees and leaves per tree in the forest. According to the results, the best number of trees and leaves per tree is 493 trees and one leaf per tree in the forest. Three statistical error values, namely, root mean square error, mean bias error, and mean absolute percentage error are used to evaluate the proposed model for the internal and external validation. Moreover, the results of the proposed model are compared with conventional random forests model, conventional artificial neural network and optimized artificial neural network model by firefly algorithm to show the superiority of the proposed hybrid model. Results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and mean bias error values of the proposed model are 18.98\%, 6.38\% and 2.86\%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed random forests model shows better performance as compared to the aforementioned models in terms of prediction accuracy and prediction speed.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R.

Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

The potential of CSP systems is estimated on the basis of a detailed solar radiation and land resource assessment in 591 districts across the country. The land suitability, favorable solar resource conditions and wind power density over the vicinity have been considered key parameters for potential estimation. On the basis of a district-wise solar and land resource assessment, the technical potential of CSP systems is estimated over 1500GW at an annual direct normal irradiance (DNI) over 1800 kWh/m2 and wind power density (WPD) ≥150W/m2 after taking into accounts the viability of different CSP technologies and land suitability criteria. The economic potential of CSP is estimated at 571GW at an annual DNI over 2000 kWh/m2 and WPD≥150W/m2 in India. The technical evaluation of CSP technologies over the potential locations have been carried through System Advisor Model (SAM) Software using the Typical Meteorological Year data of Meteonorm 7.0 weather database. In near future, it is anticipated that locations with DNI values ≥1600–1800 kWh/m2 could also become economically feasible with the development of new technologies, advancement of materials, efficient and cost-effective thermal energy storage, economy of scale, manufacturing capability along with the enhanced policy measures, etc. In the long-term, it is possible to exploit over 2700GW solar power through CSP in India with an annual DNI ≥1600 kWh/m2 and WPD≥150W/m2. The findings of this study can be used for identification of niche areas for CSP projects in India.},

	abstract = {One of the strategies for decarbonizing the energy mix is to increase the use of district heat networks, for distribution of waste heat or heat produced by renewable energy sources. However, planning such networks needs a geo-dependent energy database concerning demand and supply, incorporating their dependency on space and time. The present paper concerns the development of a bottom up statistical extrapolation model for estimating the heat demand of the Swiss building stock. The database is constructed on top of the Swiss building register, which contains basic data on building category, age, ground area and number of floors, as well as area devoted to dwellings. The model itself concerns: (i) estimation of the heated area of each building; (ii) estimation of the heat demand of each building, with disaggregation in terms of space heating (SH) and domestic hot water (DHW). The model is calibrated by way of recorded data concerning actual yearly energy consumption of around 27'000 buildings, with a classification by building category and age. The disaggregation in terms of SH and DHW allows for climatic correction of the observed data within a common climate basis. In a second step this calibration data is used for extrapolation of the demand on the entire Swiss building stock, for which the SH component is corrected by taking into account local climate characteristics. Finally, statistical methods tend to quantify the uncertainty inherent to the use of average demand values by age and category, in relation to the level of spatial aggregation.},

International standards and unified spatial processing methods across Europe ensure comparability and seamless visualisation. An open source WebGIS dynamically serves spatially explicit maps of all input and result datasets. The results show unconstrained potential areas for exploitation where the thermal conductivity (W/m*K) varies between 0.8 W/m*K and 1.2 W/m*K within the soil matrix. Depending on parameters such as grain size distribution and humidity, the highest potentials for vSGP exploitation were found in Liechtenstein, Finland, Iceland, and Norway. With over 50\% of the respective country affected, Andorra, Montenegro and Slovenia have the highest values assigned with a limitation for vSGP exploitation. The interactive tool for online searching, discovering and analysing the vSGP provide public, planners, and (non)-governmental organisations with information.

This paper utilizes a geostatistical technique for the estimation of solar radiation in Saudi Arabia. This technique includes five steps: (i) data collection, (ii) univariate analysis, (iii) experimental variogram calculations and model fitting, (iv) estimation using kriging, and (v) plotting contour maps. Variogram models are fitted to measured variograms for each month of the year. Estimates were obtained at 1500 grid points (30 × 50) between a longitude of 36.58°E and 50.00°E, and latitude of 17.17°N and 31.33°N for a grid resolution of 55 × 33 km. These values were used to plot the contour maps of solar radiation for each month of the year. To test the performance of the technique, estimates were obtained at the 41 known locations by systematically excluding one of these points from the known data. The error analysis showed a maximum mean deviation between measured and estimated values of 0.0037 (January) and a minimum of 0.0013 (March and October). The mean percent errors were found to vary between a minimum of 0.5\% and a maximum of 1.7\%. This technique may be expanded for the spatial estimation of solar radiation on regional and continental scales.},

	abstract = {This study presents a comparative analysis of the ordinary and residual kriging methods for mapping, on a 1km×1km grid size, the monthly mean of global solar radiation at the surface in Andalusia (southern Spain). The region of study is characterized by a wide range of topographic and climatic characteristic, which allows properly evaluating the two methods. The experimental dataset includes 4 years (2003–2006) of data collected at 166 stations: 112 stations were used to train the models and 54 in an independent validation procedure. Overall, the ordinary kriging method provide fair estimates: RMSE ranges from 1.63MJm−2day−1 (6.2\%) in June to around 1.44MJm−2day−1 (11.2\%) in October. In the residual kriging procedure, we propose using an external explanatory variable (derived just based on a digital elevation model) that accounts for topographic shadows cast, and that is able to explain between 13\% and 45\% of the spatial variability. Based on the combined used of the elevation and the former external variable, residual kriging estimates shows a relative improvement in RMSE values ranging from 5\% in the summer months to more than 20\% in the autumn and winter months. Particularly, RMSE is 1.44MJm−2day−1 (5.5\%) in June and 1.31MJm−2day−1 (10.2\%) in October. Explained variance also shows a considerable improvement compared to the ordinary kriging method, with all the months showing R2 values above 0.92. Results show that most part of these improvements is associated with a better estimation of the minimum values, particularly during the winter part of the year. It is finally concluded that the proposed residual kriging method is particularly valuable when mapping complex topography areas.},

A second improvement is the use of the residuals on validation patterns instead of on training patterns for estimation of the variance of the target distribution.

	abstract = {It is clear that the learning speed of feedforward neural networks is in general far slower than required and it has been a major bottleneck in their applications for past decades. Two key reasons behind may be: (1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and (2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these conventional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide good generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results based on a few artificial and real benchmark function approximation and classification problems including very large complex applications show that the new algorithm can produce good generalization performance in most cases and can learn thousands of times faster than conventional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.11For the preliminary idea of the ELM algorithm, refer to “Extreme Learning Machine: A New Learning Scheme of Feedforward Neural Networks”, Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN2004), Budapest, Hungary, 25–29 July, 2004.},

	abstract = {Accurate and reliable forecast of wind power is essential to power system operation and control. However, due to the nonstationarity of wind power series, traditional point forecasting can hardly be accurate, leading to increased uncertainties and risks for system operation. This paper proposes an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based probabilistic forecasting method for wind power generation. To account for the uncertainties in the forecasting results, several bootstrap methods have been compared for modeling the regression uncertainty, based on which the pairs bootstrap method is identiﬁed with the best performance. Consequently, a new method for prediction intervals formulation based on the ELM and the pairs bootstrap is developed. Wind power forecasting has been conducted in different seasons using the proposed approach with the historical wind power time series as the inputs alone. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation with a high potential for practical applications in power systems.},

	abstract = {Extreme learning machine (ELM) has gained increasing interest from various research fields recently. In this review, we aim to report the current state of the theoretical research and practical advances on this subject. We first give an overview of ELM from the theoretical perspective, including the interpolation theory, universal approximation capability, and generalization ability. Then we focus on the various improvements made to ELM which further improve its stability, sparsity and accuracy under general or specific conditions. Apart from classification and regression, ELM has recently been extended for clustering, feature selection, representational learning and many other learning tasks. These newly emerging algorithms greatly expand the applications of ELM. From implementation aspect, hardware implementation and parallel computation techniques have substantially sped up the training of ELM, making it feasible for big data processing and real-time reasoning. Due to its remarkable efficiency, simplicity, and impressive generalization performance, ELM have been applied in a variety of domains, such as biomedical engineering, computer vision, system identification, and control and robotics. In this review, we try to provide a comprehensive view of these advances in ELM together with its future perspectives.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a simple and fast method based on extreme learning machine (ELM) for the estimation of solar radiation in Turkey was presented. To design the ELM model, satellite data of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advanced very high-resolution radiometer from 20 locations spread over Turkey were used. The satellite-based land surface temperature, altitude, latitude, longitude, month, and city were applied as input to the ELM, and the output variable is the solar radiation. To show the applicability of the ELM model, a performance comparison in terms of the estimation capability and the learning speed was made between the ELM model and conventional artificial neural network (ANN) model with backpropagation. The comparison results showed that the ELM model gave better estimation than the ANN model for the overall test locations. Moreover, the ELM model was about 23.5 times faster than the ANN model. The method could be used by researchers or scientists to design high-efficiency solar devices such as solar power plant and photovoltaic cell. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Solar radiation data is critical to the design and operation of solar energy utilization systems, so a large number of models have been proposed and developed to estimate solar radiation in the past ten years. However, the performances of such models are controversial in diﬀerent studies, and there is a lack of systematic comparison among them. In addition, few studies pay attention to the time scales and practicability of the models. This paper focuses on solving these questions through a critical literature review and the authors believe it can beneﬁt researchers to perform further investigations about solar radiation. This paper reviews and compares the models from the points of view of time scale and estimation type for the ﬁrst time. Furthermore, a large amount of data about the evaluation metrics (root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error) from diﬀerent studies is summarized to clarify the performances of proposed models. The questions arising from the processing of source data are also carefully examined. This paper has presented a novel method to compare the estimation models and has provided a detailed analysis on available models. The results indicate that the sunshine duration fraction models and artiﬁcial neural networks have similar performances when used to estimate monthly average daily global radiation and daily global radiation, while more work is needed to study the estimation method on smaller time intervals and the mechanisms of atmospheric attenuation for solar radiation.},

	abstract = {In this work, the hourly solar radiation data collected during the period August 1, 2005–July 30, 2006 from the solar observation station in Iki Eylul campus area of Eskisehir region are studied. A two-dimensional (2-D) representation model of the hourly solar radiation data is proposed. The model provides a unique and compact visualization of the data for inspection, and enables accurate forecasting using image processing methods. Using the hourly solar radiation data mentioned above, the image model is formed in raster scan form with rows and columns corresponding to days and hours, respectively. Logically, the between-day correlations along the same hour segment provide the vertical correlations of the image, which is not available in the regular 1-D representation. To test the forecasting eﬃciency of the model, nine diﬀerent linear ﬁlters with various ﬁlter-tap conﬁgurations are optimized and tested. The results provide the necessary correlation model and prediction directions for obtaining the optimum prediction template for forecasting. Next, the 2-D forecasting performance is tested through feed-forward neural networks (NN) using the same data. The optimal linear ﬁlters and NN models are compared in the sense of root mean square error (RMSE). It is observed that the 2-D model has pronounced advantages over the 1-D representation for both linear and NN prediction methods. Due to the capability of depicting the nonlinear behavior of the input data, the NN models are found to achieve better forecasting results than linear prediction ﬁlters in both 1-D and 2-D.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) panels are a very promising technology that answers part of the increasing need for global renewable energy production, particularly in urban areas. We present a novel methodology combining Geographic Information Systems (GIS), solar models and a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, Random Forests, to estimate the potential for rooftop PV solar energy at the scale of a country. We use a hierarchical approach which divides the computation of the final potential into several steps. Each step is reached by estimating multiple variables of interest using widely available data, and combining these variables into potential values. The method for estimating each variable of interest is as follows: (1) collect all the data related to the variable, (2) train a Random Forest model based on the collected data and (3) use the model to predict the variables in unknown locations. The variables of interest include available area for PV installation on rooftops, shape, slope and direction of rooftops, global solar horizontal and tilted radiations, as well as shading factors over rooftops. The study focuses on Switzerland and provides the rooftop PV technical potential for each (200 × 200) [m2] pixel of a grid covering the entire country. The methodology, however, is generalizable to any region for which similar data is available and could therefore be useful for researchers, energy service companies, stockholders and municipalities to assess the rooftop PV capacity of the region. Prediction Intervals are also provided for the different estimated variables, in order to measure the uncertainty of the estimations. The results show that Switzerland has a large potential for rooftop PV installations. More specifically, for roofs orientated at ±90° from due south, the total estimated potential PV electricity production is about 16.29 TWh/year, which corresponds to 25.3\% of the total electricity demand in 2017.},

	abstract = {The need for reduction in CO2 emissions to mitigate global warming has resulted in increasing use of renewable energy sources. In urban areas, solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment on existing rooftops is one of the most viable sustainable energy resources. The present study uses a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and geographic information systems (GIS) to estimate the rooftop solar PV potential for the urban areas at the commune level (the smallest administrative division) in Switzerland. The rooftop solar PV potential for a total 1901 out of 2477 communes in Switzerland is estimated. Following a 6-fold cross validation, the root-mean-square error (also normalized) is used to estimate the accuracy of the different SVM models. The results show that, on average, 81\% of the total ground floor area of each building corresponds to the available roof area for the PV installation. Also considering the total available roof area for PV installation, that is, 328km2 and roof orientations within ±90° of due south, the annual potential PV electricity production for the urban areas in Switzerland is estimated at 17.86TWh (assumed 17\% efficiency and 80\% performance ratio). This amount corresponds to 28\% of Switzerland’s electricity consumption in 2015.},
